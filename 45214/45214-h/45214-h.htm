<p>I frankly confess to having received from Mr. Joel Chandler Harris
the suggestion which I have thus carried out. It was an <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e180" href="#xd21e180" name=
"xd21e180">viii</a>]</span>unerring literary instinct which impelled
him to put upon the lips of <i>Uncle Remus</i> and in the environment
of a Southern country home of half a century ago the stories which he
had found among the colored people of the South. Folk-tales, of
whatever character, speak the more directly home to the hearts of
children, whatever their own intellectual environment, in proportion as
their setting is most nearly that which naturally belongs to them. Just
as the highest value of the Homeric poems is their revelation of the
heart of man, showing that in all ages and under all conditions heart
answers to heart as face answers to face in water, so the folk-tales of
all peoples in their native form have a higher function than simply to
amuse, a higher than mere literary value; they are the child&rsquo;s
best introduction to the study of human nature.</p>
<p>The children will not be the less interested in the stories which
the Russian grandmother <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e187" href=
"#xd21e187" name="xd21e187">ix</a>]</span>told to the little peasant
boy if they discover in her wonder-tales some analogies with stories
that they already know. The adventures of <i>Master Reinecke</i> and
<i>Mrs. Petz</i>, of <i>Isegrim</i> and <i>Lampe</i>, will surely
remind them of the Uncle Remus tales; they will find some suggestion of
<i>Kamer-es-zaman</i> and the <i>Princess Budoor</i> in the story of
&ldquo;The Beg and the Fox,&rdquo; a hint of the &ldquo;City of
Brass,&rdquo; in that of &ldquo;The Vila in Muhlenberg,&rdquo; a faint
reflection of the &ldquo;Arabian Nights&rdquo; story of the
<i>Fisherman</i> in the tale of the &ldquo;Three Eels,&rdquo; and they
will be especially pleased to recognize their old friend&mdash;and
<i>Sindbad the Sailor&rsquo;s</i>&mdash;the roc, in the bird
<i>Kumrikusha</i>. The transformations which are so enchanting a
feature of the &ldquo;Arabian Nights&rdquo; are here suggested in the
story of &ldquo;Steelpacha,&rdquo; while the dress of feathers, most
universal of folk-fancies, found among every people in the world, and
most perfectly developed in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e217"
href="#xd21e217" name="xd21e217">x</a>]</span>Arabian &ldquo;Story of
Hassan of Bassora,&rdquo; here appears in the tale of &ldquo;The Golden
Apple-tree and the Nine Pea-hens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That these stories originated in that fountain-head of wonder-tales,
the East, is very evident. They give more than a few suggestions of
biblical story: the servant sent to announce the readiness of the feast
(a courtesy of which I was myself the recipient in Syria last winter),
the Delilah-like importunities by which the youngest sister lures from
<i>Steelpacha</i> the secret of his strength, are perhaps the most
striking instances.</p>
<p>Although this preface is not written for the children, yet as there
are children who occasionally dip into prefaces, let me call the
attention of such to the difference, both in style and point of view,
between these stories and those which they have received from the
brothers Grimm, from Hans Andersen, and from a host of later writers.
All of these drew their material from the same sources <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e226" href="#xd21e226" name=
"xd21e226">xi</a>]</span>as those of the Russian grandmother; but their
cultivated minds have worked this material into exquisite literary
forms. Not so your own nurses, or even your mothers, who told you
wonder-tales before you were old enough to read. Not so the village
story-tellers in far-away parts of the world, who, like the Russian
grandmother, still hand down to the children the stories they received
from parents and grandparents. These sometimes lose the connection;
they add little local touches&mdash;sweet wine from Zagorj&eacute;,
going home to Varazdin, and the like&mdash;they give to certain
incidents the setting with which they are themselves familiar; most
artlessly they interweave such results of modern invention and
discovery as are familiar to them, with such blank ignorance of
physical facts as is shown by bringing in the sun, the moon, the winds,
as persons. Many of you know how beautifully George Macdonald did this
sort of thing in his story &ldquo;At <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e228" href="#xd21e228" name="xd21e228">xii</a>]</span>the Back of
the North Wind,&rdquo; and you perfectly well perceive the difference
between that story and such a tale as, for instance, &ldquo;So Born, So
Die,&rdquo; in this book. When you are older you will recognize that it
is precisely the difference between literature and folk-lore.</p>
<p>That many of these wonder-tales passed through Mohammedan minds on
their way to the Russian grandmother, or her great-grandmother, is
evident. &ldquo;The Beg and the Fox&rdquo; is a striking case in point;
it almost seems as if the story ought, like the stories of the
&ldquo;Arabian Nights,&rdquo; to close with the exclamation,
&ldquo;There is no God but God, the High, the Great!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The humor of these stories, however, is unmistakably Slavonic. There
is a fine pungency&mdash;not Oriental, though Oriental humor is very
pungent&mdash;in certain of the endings, &ldquo;I have heard a lie, I
have told a lie, and God give you joy!&rdquo; or after a peculiarly
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e234" href="#xd21e234" name=
"xd21e234">xiii</a>]</span>impossible story, &ldquo;Whoever believes it
will be blessed!&rdquo; The underlying pathos of the story of the
Basil-plant suggests the exquisite sentiment of Hans Andersen&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Steadfast Tin Soldier&rdquo;; but its excessive simplicity, its
dropped threads of thought, forbid the idea that it has been worked
over by any more sophisticated mind than that of the Russian
grandmother.</p>
<p>In this simple-hearted story-teller I have tried to reproduce some
lineaments of the peasant mother to whom, he tells us, Dr. Kraus owes
his first impulse to folk-lore research. She was one of nine children
of a poor pedler, brought up in a village of charcoal burners, deep in
a Slavonian forest. She was illiterate, like our Russian grandmother,
but like her intelligent and learned in the wonder-lore of her people.
Her son pays her a lovely tribute in the preface to the first volume of
his collection: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e238" href=
"#xd21e238" name="xd21e238">xiv</a>]</span></p>
<p>She grew up like a flower in the hedge-row, among the simple peasant
folk whose manners and spirit she made entirely her own. The villagers,
who had a little education, therefore called her, contemptuously,
<i>baba vracana</i> (the little old sorceress), but the illiterate
peasants lovingly named her <i>nas&aacute; baba Eva</i> (our little
mother Eve). But for once the villagers were right, my mother is a
sorceress; else, how comes it that I so constantly fall under the spell
of her enchantments ... I solemnly declare that if there is a true word
in metempsychosis, and it is left to our choice to return to the
present state of existence, nothing would so sorely tempt me back, no
crown, not even that of learning&mdash;as the simple assurance of the
All-Father that he would give me again the same dear mother, though I
were to go begging with her through the world.</p>

<h2 class="super">The Russian Grandmother&rsquo;s Wonder-Tales</h2>
<h2 class="label">CHAPTER I</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE LITTLE BOY AND THE GRANDMOTHER</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The little boy&rsquo;s father was <i>starosta</i>,
that is, Elder of the village, and the house the little boy lived in
was grander than any other, on whichever side of the long street you
might look. For it had two rooms opening into the court, and all the
other houses, even that of the <i>pop</i>, who said Mass in the church
on Sunday, had only one. And this grand house was not crowded like the
other houses, where the grandparents and the parents and all the
married sons and their wives and children lived in the one <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name="pb2">2</a>]</span>room. The
<i>starosta</i> was not a <i>bolshak</i>, or head of a family, of the
old-fashioned sort. He did not consider that he had a right to rule his
children like a despot and make them work for him, however old they
might be, as many of the fathers in the village did. He even approved
of young people setting up housekeeping by themselves. Therefore,
though some of the older <i>bolshaks</i> shook their heads and said
harm would come of it, when the little boy&rsquo;s elder brother
married he permitted him to have a house of his own. It was at the far
end of the village.</p>
<p>Thus, in the little boy&rsquo;s house there were only the
grandmother, the father and mother, the three daughters, the half-grown
son, and the little boy. They were not at all crowded, you see, for
they had two rooms. The cowherd woman and the two <i>moujiks</i> who
helped the <i>starosta</i> on the land, slept, of course, in the stalls
with the cattle under the shed that went around three sides of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3" name=
"pb3">3</a>]</span>court. In their warm sheepskin coats, made with the
wool outside, they would not have been at all cold, even if the cows
beside which they slept had not kept them warm.</p>
<p>The family always slept warm, too, for father, mother, and all the
children slept on the great tile stove which occupied the centre of the
larger room, and in this stove the fire never went entirely out. The
grandmother did not sleep on this stove, however. The <i>starosta</i>
greatly honored his old mother, and to her he gave the second room in
the house for herself alone. She had a stove all to herself, and slept
on it all alone, except when the little boy ran away from the great
room and cuddled down beside his grandmother for the night.</p>
<p>She did not tell him stories then, for night is the time for
sleeping, and grandmother was tired after a long day in the fields. But
on rainy days, when the <i>starosta</i> would not permit his old mother
to do field work, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name=
"pb4">4</a>]</span>grandmother would sit at home and spin, and then for
happy times!</p>
<p>It was growing cold weather; the harvests were all in, the rains had
begun, and grandmother was sitting by the stove, with her distaff and
spindle and a basket of wool by her side. In came the little boy,
settled himself in a snug place on the stove-top, and said, very
coaxingly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me a story, little grandmamma!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The grandmother ceased the song she had been singing, and
answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I tell you about the Wolf that wanted to be a
Roman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, yes!&rdquo; exclaimed the little boy. &ldquo;Tell me
about the wolf!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the grandmother began.</p>
<div id="ch1.1" class="div2 story"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">THE WOLF AS A ROMAN</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time, Isegrim, the Wolf, sat in the forest
and thought to himself, &ldquo;Why should I be a wolf and go around
devouring <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name=
"pb5">5</a>]</span>the other beasts? It would be much better for me to
go out into the world. What if I should go to Rome? Yes, that&rsquo;s
it, I will be a Roman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Off he set in the best of spirits, and on the way he met a Sow. The
Sow bristled up in terror, but Isegrim cried out, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be
frightened, Gruntelind! I am done with Gruntelinds forever. I am going
to be a Roman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not long after he met a He-goat. The He-goat was greatly frightened
when he saw Isegrim, but the Wolf cried out, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be
frightened, Longbeard! I&rsquo;m not bothering myself with Longbeards.
I am going to be a Roman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next he met an old Mare. She was horribly frightened, but he quieted
her, saying, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened, Skinny-bones! I
don&rsquo;t waste my time with old jades like you. I am going to be a
Roman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On went the Wolf for two whole days, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb6" href="#pb6" name="pb6">6</a>]</span>when he began to feel a
mighty hunger. So he turned back, and presently he came to the pasture
where he had met the old Mare. Now was the Mare terrified. She quaked
with fear, and well she might, for the Wolf said to her, &ldquo;Mare, I
am going to devour you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dare you say so!&rdquo; exclaimed the Mare. &ldquo;You
told me you were a Roman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roman here or Roman there,&rdquo; snarled Isegrim, &ldquo;I
am going to gnaw your bones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; returned the Mare; &ldquo;if there is no
help for it, come again by and by, when I am plumper and
juicier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the Wolf went on his way. Presently he met the He-goat.
&ldquo;Ho, Longbeard,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;your time has
come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare you to touch me!&rdquo; replied the He-goat.
&ldquo;You are not a Wolf; you are a Roman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roman here or Roman there,&rdquo; retorted the Wolf, &ldquo;I
shall dine on you to-day.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7"
href="#pb7" name="pb7">7</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;What must be, must,&rdquo; replied the He-goat; &ldquo;but
since you are bound to eat me, just grant me life till the woods are
green again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Wolf was beguiled, and on he went till he met the Sow.
&ldquo;Listen to me, Gruntelind,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I am going to
make short work with you now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You daren&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; replied the Sow. &ldquo;You
are no Wolf; you are a noble Roman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roman here or Roman there,&rdquo; said the Wolf, &ldquo;I am
bound to eat you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; replied the Sow; &ldquo;since you insist,
come another day, when I am fatter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Wolf consented, and away he went to look for that Mare
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen now, Skinny-bones,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;you are to
die on the spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If your mind is really made up,&rdquo; replied the Mare,
&ldquo;I have nothing to say; but first look at my left hind hoof, for
my master <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8</a>]</span>had me shod the other day, and the smith marked my
age upon the horseshoe. Read how old I am, and then you will be able to
boast what an old Mare you have eaten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Wolf thought this a fine plan, and he drew near. Then the Mare
raised her hoof and dealt Isegrim so smart a blow on the head that he
ran off with a cracked crown, as fast as his heels could carry him.</p>
<p>On the way he met the Sow. &ldquo;See here, Gruntelind,&rdquo; he
said to her, &ldquo;there is no escape this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; replied the Sow; &ldquo;since there is no
help for it, just lead me around by the ear until I say good-by to all
my kith and kin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isegrim seized her by the ear, when she set up so shrill and piteous
a squealing that the Swine all rushed to the spot from far and near,
and falling upon Cousin Isegrim they almost tore him in pieces. Mangled
and bleeding, he made his escape, and meeting <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name="pb9">9</a>]</span>the He-goat,
he said, &ldquo;Your time has come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that is the case,&rdquo; replied the He-goat, &ldquo;just
stand in the middle of the field, with your mouth wide open, and my
brothers and I will jump down your throat, one after the other. Then
you won&rsquo;t be hungry again for many a long day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This plan greatly pleased Isegrim, and he took his place in the
middle of the field, with his mouth wide open. Then all the He-goats
ran against him, butting at him, before and behind, till he could
neither hear nor see, and it was all he could do to escape to the
nearest wood.</p>
<p>There he spied a Cock, and said to him, &ldquo;Now, see here,
Gockeling, I am not to be fooled by you, at any rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cock replied, &ldquo;Just look at me once, how thin I am and
what big feathers I have. Why should you bother to pluck me? It would
save you a world of trouble if I got <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb10" href="#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span>up into this tree and
just flew down your throat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isegrim thought this a fine idea. So Gockeling flew up into the
tree. He hopped from branch to branch until he was in perfect safety,
and then crowed loud and lustily to proclaim his escape.</p>
<p>At this the Wolf sank into deep thought. &ldquo;My father lived
comfortably,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;and was never a Roman;
neither should I have been one&mdash;it has served me right. My father
was no expert in Mares&rsquo; paces, yet he lived in peace and
happiness; neither should I have been one&mdash;it has served me right.
My father was no Swine musician, but he lived well for all that;
neither should I have been one&mdash;it has served me right. My father
never measured a field with He-goats, but he grew gray honorably for
all that; only one thing rankles&mdash;that this scoundrel up in the
tree crows over me so. It would be none too good for me if <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name="pb11">11</a>]</span>some one
should jump from behind the tree and knock me over the head.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="figureHead">Took his place in the middle of the field, with

</div>
<p>As luck would have it, a <i>moujik</i> was standing behind the tree,
and he fetched the Wolf a blow on the head with his axe. Then Isegrim
cried out with his last breath, &ldquo;Well, I vow, on this blessed day
one can&rsquo;t even talk to himself without being made sorry for
it!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The little boy was thoughtful for a few minutes. &ldquo;Did you know
that Wolf, little grandma?&rdquo; he asked at length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not I,&rdquo; replied the grandmother; &ldquo;it was my
great-great-grandmother who knew him.&rdquo; <span class=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER II</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE MOTHER&rsquo;S F&Ecirc;TE-DAY</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was the f&ecirc;te-day of the little boy&rsquo;s
mother, and she was dressed in the beautiful clothes that had been her
mother&rsquo;s and her grandmother&rsquo;s festival clothes. Her gown,
which she called her <i>sarafam</i>, was of a lovely light-blue stuff,
and on her head she wore a diadem of gold, all studded with little
pearls. Many of the village people came to kiss the
<i>baboushka&rsquo;s</i> hand and to bring her gifts, so that the house
was quite crowded with people drinking coffee and talking loudly. When
the <i>baboushka</i> went to church to offer thanks she put on her long
fur-trimmed <i>chougaii</i> (we should call it a coat), and over that a
thick, wadded <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=
"pb13">13</a>]</span><i>duchegreika</i>, or hug-me-tight. It was a cold
day, and she was not too warmly clothed, but if her f&ecirc;te-day had
come in the heat of summer she would have worn these things just the
same.</p>
<p>The little boy went to church with his mother, and when they came
back he was very hungry. But the feast-table was not yet spread, for
the <i>starosta</i> and the older children were still in the fields
pulling stubble. The grandmother was not in the fields, for the day was
too cold, so the little boy went into her room. She had on her festival
clothes in honor of the feast, but she was spinning as usual and
humming a little song.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so hungry, grandmother,&rdquo; said the little
boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you spoil the feast by eating now?&rdquo; asked the
grandmother. &ldquo;The best way is to forget all about being hungry
till the feast begins.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href=
"#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I forget?&rdquo; asked the little boy. &ldquo;My
mouth cries &lsquo;food!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If little grandmother puts a story in your ears will your
mouth cease crying?&rdquo; asked the grandmother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, yes!&rdquo; cried the little boy.</p>
<p>So grandmother told the story of</p>

<h3 class="main">THE SICK LION</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time a Lion lay sick in his den. Master
Petz, the Bear, called to pay his respects; whereupon the Lion thus
spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Bruin, tell me the honest truth&mdash;is it, or is it
not very close in this den?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed!&rdquo; replied Petz, &ldquo;it does smell
horribly here.&rdquo; Upon this the Lion flew into a rage and tore the
Bear into a thousand pieces.</p>
<p>Lampe, the Hare, was standing near the door of the den, and observed
this mishap. Tremblingly he approached the Lion, who <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>asked
him, &ldquo;Tell me, dear Lampe, is it not close in my den?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, no!&rdquo; replied the Hare; &ldquo;why should it
be close? On the contrary, the air seems to me delightfully
fresh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lie!&rdquo; retorted the Lion, in high dudgeon; &ldquo;it
is not delightfully fresh; on the contrary, it is disgustingly
close,&rdquo; and he tore the Hare limb from limb.</p>
<p>Isegrim, the Wolf, saw and heard all this, for he was standing near
the door of the den. He stepped in, and bowed low before the Lion, who
immediately put the same question to him, &ldquo;See here, Isegrim,
tell me truly and honestly, is it close in my den or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither, sire!&rdquo; replied the obsequious Wolf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you good-for-nothing liar!&rdquo; roared the Lion,
&ldquo;it must be either one or the other; either it is close or it is
not,&rdquo; and he seized him and tore him to pieces. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span></p>
<p>Reinecke, the Fox, was looking in from outside, and now he drew near
to pay his respects. So the Lion asked him, &ldquo;See here, Master
Reinecke, do you tell me now, is it close in my den or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, august monarch,&rdquo; replied Reinecke very
humbly, &ldquo;but by all I hold blessed I am not able to tell you, for
I have taken such a cold that, upon honor, I cannot smell. But I do
hate a lie from the bottom of my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the Lion spared Reinecke&rsquo;s life because he had such a
clever wit.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;Will the <i>B&aacute;by</i> and the little boy graciously
come to supper?&rdquo; asked the cow-herd woman, opening the door.
&ldquo;The gracious <i>baboushka&rsquo;s</i> feast is ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the little boy and his grandmother, whom they call the
<i>B&aacute;by</i> in Russia, gayly went in to the feast. <span class=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER III</h2>
<h2 class="main">SATURDAY AFTERNOON</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was Saturday afternoon, and the little boy had been
with his mother to the village vapor-bath. After that he had been
dressed in his Sunday clothes. His white shirt, which he called his
<i>roubachka</i>, hung outside of his best <i>portki</i>, or loose,
colored trousers. His legs were wound round with many bands of colored
cloth, called <i>onontchi</i>, and on his feet he wore <i>bachmaki</i>,
or shoes. When he grew to be a man he would wear very high,
large-topped <i>sapoghi</i>, with his trousers tucked into them, like
his father, and then he would not need <i>onontchi</i> on his legs. But
he was only a little boy yet.</p>
<p>The <i>popod&rsquo;ya</i> had come to call on his mother. She was
the priest&rsquo;s wife, and was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18"
href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>very old, and the little boy did
not care for what she and his mother were talking about. So he stole
away into his grandmother&rsquo;s room. The grandmother was kneeling
before the <i>ikon</i>, the sacred picture of the Virgin and Child,
which hung on the wall with a tiny lamp lighted before it. The little
boy would not disturb his grandmother while she was saying her Saturday
evening prayer, but he hoped she would not be long. Perhaps she was
almost through, for presently she rose from her knees, lifting herself
by her stick. The little boy ran to help her, and led her to the stove.
She sat down upon it, for her knees were cold from the clay floor, and
the little boy climbed up beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now the work is all done, little grandma,&rdquo; he said,
putting his hands on either side of her face, &ldquo;and you can tell
me a long story, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum, hum!&rdquo; said the grandmother, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=
"pb19">19</a>]</span>pretending to look cross. &ldquo;Why should I tell
you a long story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, because I have my Sunday clothes on, and must not play in
the dirt!&rdquo; replied the little boy. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know a
long story, grandma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like to hear about</p>

<h3 class="main">&ldquo;WHITELING&rsquo;S WAR WITH ISEGRIM?&rdquo;</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">asked the <i>B&aacute;by</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, that I should!&rdquo; cried the little boy.</p>
<p>So the grandmother began:</p>
<p>Once upon a time there was a <i>moujik</i> who had a perfectly white
Dog, which he called Whiteling. Now Whiteling had struck up a great
friendship with Isegrim, the Wolf, and one day each made a solemn
compact never to betray the other in any of their stealings.</p>
<p>Not long after, Isegrim said to Whiteling one day, &ldquo;I intend
to make a call upon <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20"
name="pb20">20</a>]</span>your master&rsquo;s swine to-night; so do you
keep no watch, but just lie as still as possible, and don&rsquo;t wake
up the whole family with your barking, as you usually do, for you know
that they will move heaven and earth to capture me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kill all the swine, if you like,&rdquo; replied Whiteling;
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t betray you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A word is enough, brother; I shall be there,&rdquo; said
Isegrim; and so the friends parted.</p>
<p>Punctually at nightfall Isegrim appeared and greeted Whiteling
heartily, saying, &ldquo;I gave you my word, and as you see, here I
am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get to work, then,&rdquo; replied Whiteling; &ldquo;you have
nothing to fear from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isegrim crept cautiously to the swine-pen. He had all the work in
the world to get in, and once in, he had hardly begun his meal when the
swine broke out in fearful squealings and gruntings. Whiteling, at the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name=
"pb21">21</a>]</span>house-door, no sooner heard the noise than he
began to bark and whine with all his might, waking all the family with
his noise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes our Whiteling howl so?&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;We
must go out and see what the trouble is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So all the family went out, and hearing the squealing of the swine,
they hastened to the pigpen. Peeping in, they saw the Wolf and set upon
him with clubs and fists, belaboring him so soundly that he barely
escaped with a whole skin.</p>
<p>Waiting till the family had returned to bed, Isegrim crept back, and
seizing Whiteling by the throat, &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I
have caught you now. You pledged me your word not to bark, and you
broke your promise. No, I&rsquo;ll never forgive you. Just look at me
once, what a plight I&rsquo;m in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whiteling began to beg. &ldquo;Ah, let me go, let me go, dear, sweet
brother Isegrim; forgive me just this once; I&rsquo;ll never do it
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name=
"pb22">22</a>]</span>again; come again and steal whenever you like; you
may be perfectly sure of me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you ever play me another such trick?&rdquo; asked
Isegrim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, never again!&rdquo; said Whiteling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; said the Wolf, &ldquo;you may go free
this once; but next time, remember, hold your tongue!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few days later Isegrim paid the swine a second visit, but he had
hardly crept into the pen when Whiteling set up a howl so loud and
clear that all the household sprang out of bed to see what was the
matter. A second time they found the Wolf, fell upon him, and beat him
half-dead. The unlucky visitor barely escaped with his life, and full
of wrath, he hid behind the hedge and waited till the household were
asleep. Then, seeing Whiteling before the house-door, he cried to him,
&ldquo;Just wait once, Whiteling; your last half-hour strikes when you
fall into my clutches! If you weren&rsquo;t just where <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name="pb23">23</a>]</span>you are,
safe at the house-door, I&rsquo;d soon pay you off; but my time will
come before long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Whiteling began to beg. &ldquo;Dearest Isegrim, it is indeed
true that I have brought you into a terrible pickle, but don&rsquo;t
kill me; let me go this time. I&rsquo;ll never do it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Wolf replied, &ldquo;Neither now nor ever; you cheated me
out of that meal of swine&rsquo;s flesh, and three days from now you
must meet me in battle. I will summon my forces, and do you summon
yours&mdash;that is, if you can muster any. If you don&rsquo;t show up,
I&rsquo;ll soon know where to find you, and I&rsquo;ll drag you there
myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; returned Whiteling, &ldquo;come what may,
I&rsquo;ll be there without fail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Isegrim hastened away to get his troops together, and meeting the
Wild Boar he said to him, &ldquo;Will you be on my side? There is going
to be war between me and Whiteling three days from now.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name=
"pb24">24</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; replied the Wild Boar, &ldquo;indeed I will be on
your side!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little farther Isegrim met Master Petz, the Bear, told him the
whole matter, and begged him to be on his side. Petz most cheerfully
promised his help.</p>
<p>Later, he met Reinecke, the Fox, and told him the whole story.
Reinecke assured him that he might certainly count upon his
help&mdash;how could he ever hesitate to stand by his old crony against
the common enemy?</p>
<p>Then said Isegrim, &ldquo;Now we are quite enough; but I must spy
out Whiteling and learn what forces he has. Then I will let you know
that we are all ready for war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isegrim betook himself to Whiteling&rsquo;s house, and standing in
the lane looked over the hedge. &ldquo;Are you ready, Whiteling?&rdquo;
he asked. &ldquo;To-morrow is the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be ready,&rdquo; replied Whiteling in a tone of
deepest dejection; &ldquo;but tell me precisely, where is the battle to
be?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;You know very well,&rdquo; replied Isegrim; &ldquo;yonder,
under the tree we agreed upon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the Dog, and slunk sorrowfully away to
the other side of the farm-yard. There the Tomcat met him and said,
&ldquo;Why, my dear Whiteling, what can be the matter, what makes you
so sad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Whiteling answered, &ldquo;My dear Grimalkin, you don&rsquo;t
know where the shoe pinches. Will you come to my aid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what are you talking about?&rdquo; asked the surprised
Cat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just think of it,&rdquo; replied the Dog, &ldquo;to-morrow I
have to fight Isegrim; we have declared war to the knife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, oh, my Whiteling, cheer up! I&rsquo;ll stand by you to
the death. Just you go to friend Quacker, the Drake, and engage his
help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a lighter heart Whiteling sought friend Quacker and begged his
friendly aid. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure, to be sure; I am your comrade. Why should I leave
a friend in the lurch? Go to friend Ganner, the Gander, and ask him if
he feels like having a part in the war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So said and so done. Whiteling found the Gander, explained the
affair and begged for his help. &ldquo;Of course, why should I not be
ready to help? Aren&rsquo;t you our guard every night to keep Reinecke
from making off with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Whiteling, &ldquo;I think we are strong
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Early next morning Isegrim met his allies upon the battle-field
under the appointed tree. He hid the Wild Boar beneath a thick bed of
moss which grew upon the ground, and bade Reinecke climb into the tree,
saying, &ldquo;You must be our sentinel, Master. Keep watch when
Whiteling appears with his troop, and give us secret intelligence. You,
too, Petz, must scramble up the tree, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb27" href="#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span>but I will crouch down in
ambush behind the trunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile Whiteling was also disposing his forces. &ldquo;Grimalkin
and Ganner, you are the infantry. I see that your weapon is ready,
Grimalkin&rdquo; (for Grimalkin held his tail upright, by way of
musket); &ldquo;and you, Ganner, must hiss your very best. Quacker, you
shall be the drummer. I reserve to myself the command. March according
to orders, and fall to when I give the word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Whiteling and his comrades went gayly to the
battle&mdash;Whiteling and his drummer in front, Grimalkin and Ganner
bringing up the rear. Quacker drummed his
prettiest&mdash;&ldquo;Quack-quack, quack-quack, quack-quack!&rdquo;
The Gander hissed and the Tomcat strutted along in dignified silence,
carrying his tail straight upright like a musket.</p>
<p>When Reinecke perceived the approaching company he cried to Isegrim,
&ldquo;Cousin, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=
"pb28">28</a>]</span>cousin, here come two soldiers with a drummer and
a captain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you say?&rdquo; asked Isegrim in
dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, here come two soldiers with a drummer and a
captain,&rdquo; replied Reinecke. &ldquo;The soldier is loading his
gun, he takes aim, he is about to fire&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! woe be to us poor fellows,&rdquo; moaned the Wild Boar
from under the moss. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all over with us! We fight with
unequal forces!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Courage, courage, fellows,&rdquo; cried Isegrim, trying to
rally his troops; &ldquo;just bear yourselves bravely; all is not lost;
we&rsquo;ll make short work of them yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the midst of all this confusion Whiteling and his troops reached
the spot unperceived. Grimalkin, catching a glimpse of the Wild
Boar&rsquo;s ear sticking out of the moss, took it for a mouse, and
springing upon it, bit into it with his sharp teeth. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span>Wild
Boar sprang up in terror and took wildly to flight, while Grimalkin, no
less terrified, scrambled frantically up the tree into the very face of
Master Petz. The Bear, not prepared for this unexpected encounter, lost
his balance and tumbled to the ground, half-killing himself by the
fall. More frightened than ever, the Tomcat scrambled blindly up to the
tree-top.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, it&rsquo;s my turn,&rdquo; thought Reinecke to himself,
and immediately tumbled down in affright. Grimalkin tumbled after,
while the Drake kept drumming, &ldquo;Quack-quack, quack-quack,
quack-quack,&rdquo; and Ganner hissed with all his might. Thus was
Isegrim&rsquo;s host ignominiously routed. The Wolf himself, however,
still cowered behind the tree, his head buried in the moss.</p>
<p>When the besiegers had withdrawn, Isegrim&rsquo;s scattered forces
drew together and began to count their honorable scars. Said Master
Petz, &ldquo;More dead than alive from <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb30" href="#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>my heavy fall, I barely
managed to make my escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A piece of my ear is gone,&rdquo; said the Boar. &ldquo;He
cut it off with his sword.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us be thankful, fellows,&rdquo; concluded Reinecke,
&ldquo;that we are no worse off, for if they had been able to fire off
one more cannon we should have been hopelessly lost!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew that Dog,&rdquo; said the little boy. &ldquo;I
think he is wiser than our Watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The beasts were wiser those days,&rdquo; replied the
grandmother. &ldquo;That was my great-great-grandmother&rsquo;s
time.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=

<h2 class="main">THE FIRE OF SHAVINGS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The snow had fallen heavily, and some of the sheep
were missing. The two <i>moujiks</i> put on their warm sheepskin
clothes and went to look for them, taking Watch, the sheep-dog, with
them. The <i>starosta</i> sat in the house, making a plough-handle out
of a tree-branch which he had cut down one day long ago because he saw
it was the right shape for a plough-handle in case he should ever need
a new one. The little boy gathered up the shavings that fell from under
the long, two-handled knife. He played with them until he was tired of
them, and then he gathered them all in the skirt of his shirt and
carried them to his grandmother&rsquo;s room. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I have brought you some shavings to make you warm,
grandmother,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>His grandmother opened the stove-door, where the fire was
smouldering, carefully covered up, for fuel is dear. The little boy put
his shavings in, one by one, and watched them as they slowly caught
fire and broke into a blaze. When they were all burned up he went and
stood by his grandmother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they make you warm, little grandma?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice and warm,&rdquo; answered the grandmother. &ldquo;Now,
what can I do for you in thanks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A story, a story!&rdquo; cried the little boy, climbing upon
the stove to be comfortable. And the grandmother told the story of</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">THE BEAR, THE BOAR, AND THE FOX</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A Bear, a Boar, and a Fox once went into partnership
to till a field and raise some wheat, that they might earn their bread
honestly. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name=
"pb33">33</a>]</span>Said the Boar, &ldquo;I will break into a granary
and steal the seed, and with my snout I will plough up the
field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will be the sower,&rdquo; said the Bear; and Reinecke
added, &ldquo;I will spread the earth over the seed with my
tail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the field was ploughed and the seed sown. By and by came
harvest-time, and the friends took counsel together as to the reaping.
Said the Boar, &ldquo;I will cut the grain.&rdquo; Said the Bear,
&ldquo;I will bind the sheaves.&rdquo; And the Fox said, &ldquo;I will
glean the scattered ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The grain was cut and the sheaves set up. The next thing was the
threshing. Said the Boar, &ldquo;I will provide the
threshing-floor.&rdquo; &ldquo;I will carry the sheaves,&rdquo; said
the Bear, &ldquo;and will do the threshing into the bargain.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll shake out the sheaves,&rdquo; said the Boar,
&ldquo;and break off the ears from the stalks.&rdquo; &ldquo;I will
clear away the chaff with my tail,&rdquo; said the Fox. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I will winnow the grain,&rdquo; said the Boar, &ldquo;and
separate the straw from the wheat;&rdquo; and Gossip Petz added,
&ldquo;And I will attend to the dividing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so the grain was threshed.</p>
<p>Next came the Bear to do the dividing, but he was neither fair nor
honest, for he gave the Boar all the straw and kept all the grain for
himself, not leaving the least thing for the Fox. At this Reinecke flew
into a rage and threatened them both with the law, saying he would
bring the emperor&rsquo;s officer to divide it all fairly and
squarely.</p>
<p>Away he went for the officer, leaving the Boar and the Bear greatly
terrified. Said Master Petz to the Boar, &ldquo;Just bury yourself in
the straw, my child, while I clamber up into yonder pear-tree.&rdquo;
The Boar at once vanished under the straw, while the Bear scrambled up
into the pear-tree.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Reinecke set out, and on the way he met a Cat, whom he
invited to come <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name=
"pb35">35</a>]</span>and hunt mice with him upon a certain
threshing-floor.</p>
<p>The Cat gladly accepted the invitation, for she full well knew that
there are plenty of mice in a threshing-floor; but on the way she kept
hunting birds in the bushes along the roadside. The Bear, who was
watching from the pear-tree, espied her from afar, and called down to
the Boar:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are in a pretty scrape, dear Boar, for here comes Master
Reinecke and a fearful monster with him. He wears the fur coat of a
Marten and is killing birds upon the wing all along the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time the Bear lost sight of the Cat, which had reached the
threshing-floor under cover of the grass, and was creeping about in the
straw in search of mice. Full of curiosity, the Boar stuck his head out
a little way to see what was going on; when the Cat, mistaking his
snout for a mouse, sprang forward and buried her claws in it.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name=
"pb36">36</a>]</span>At this the Boar gave a fearful grunt, and rushed
frantically into a neighboring stream, while the Bear, who, from the
uproar, concluded that the Cat had killed the Boar and would seize him
next, tumbled headlong from the pear-tree in terror, and breaking his
neck by the fall, perished miserably.</p>
<p>So Master Reinecke got all the grain and the straw into the
bargain.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;I am glad he got it all,&rdquo; said the little boy.
&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t fair of Petz and the Boar to serve Reinecke that
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master Reinecke is generally able to look out for
himself,&rdquo; said the grandmother. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="main">FROST-BITTEN TOES</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a great shouting and hurrahing in the court,
for the <i>moujiks</i> had found the sheep and were driving them home.
The little boy ran out to see them come in. They were trembling with
cold and looked very weak, for they had had nothing to eat for two
days. They had been buried under the snow, and it had taken all that
time to find them. They were glad to go into their pen, and the little
boy was glad when his father gave him a pail with food in it and let
him help the <i>moujiks</i> feed them.</p>
<p>The cow-herd woman came to watch. &ldquo;You should not have come
out in bare feet,&rdquo; she said to the little boy. &ldquo;Where are
your <i>bachmaki</i>?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href=
"#pb38" name="pb38">38</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Your feet are bare,&rdquo; replied the little boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am old and am used to it,&rdquo; said the cow-herd woman.
&ldquo;You will freeze your toes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the sheep were all fed the little boy&rsquo;s toes began to
ache, and he ran into the house. &ldquo;Keep away from the fire,&rdquo;
said his eldest sister, who was weaving at the loom in the corner.
&ldquo;If you go near the fire your toes will sting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little boy&rsquo;s toes were stinging already, and he began to
cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run away to grandmother,&rdquo; said the eldest sister.
&ldquo;She will warm your toes with her hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The grandmother heard the little boy crying and she came to the door
to see what was the matter, for it makes a grandmother&rsquo;s heart
ache to hear a child&rsquo;s cries. When she saw the bare toes, white
with cold, she gathered the little boy up in her arms <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name="pb39">39</a>]</span>and
carried him to her room. There she sat down, far away from the fire,
took the cold feet in her hands and rubbed them to make them warm. Then
the little boy stopped crying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are warm now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t
want to get down. It is nice in your lap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may sit here while I tell you a story,&rdquo; said the
grandmother. &ldquo;Then you must get down, for I haven&rsquo;t
finished my stint of spinning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said the little boy; and the grandmother told
him the story of</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">THE MAN, THE HARE, THE FOX, AND THE BEAR</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Not far from a Hare&rsquo;s form a Bear once had her
den, and Master Lampe often gave himself the treat of visiting the den
in Petz&rsquo;s absence and teasing the little Petzes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dear little birds,&rdquo; he would say, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=
"pb40">40</a>]</span>&ldquo;do let me hear your enchanting
songs!&rdquo; And he would spit at them, and make all manner of game of
them into the bargain.</p>
<p>Whenever Mrs. Petz came home the young ones would bitterly complain
how a little Hare had been there making game of them. At this old Petz
waxed very angry, and growled, &ldquo;Just wait once, wait, Master
Lampe! I&rsquo;ll catch you yet and fling you into a hole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Mrs. Petz hid herself in the back of the den, and sure enough
along came Master Lampe and began to tease the young bears. No sooner
did Mrs. Petz hear him than she sprang upon him from her hiding-place.
But, quick as lightning, Lampe was off in the woods, with Mrs. Petz
after him. Lampe fled through bush and brier, Petz always close upon
his heels.</p>
<p>At last Lampe sprang through a cloven tree and Petz followed him.
Unluckily she stuck fast in the narrow cleft and, do what <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>she
would, she could not escape from her prison.</p>
<p>Presently a Man came along, and Mrs. Petz implored him thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Man, do set me free! I know where there is a hollow tree
full of honey in the forest; you could bring a great cask and fill it
as full as you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you telling the honest truth?&rdquo; asked the Man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The honest truth,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Petz. &ldquo;I can make
you rich in honey, and all I have to say is to give you this warning:
Never, if you love your own life, do you tell a living soul how a
miserable little Hare made a fool of a strong She-bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Man promised her, trust and true, and lifting his axe he struck
a blow at the cloven tree. The tree fell apart, Petz was again free,
and she at once led the Man to the honey-tree. The Man returned home,
yoked up his oxen, put a cask in the cart, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>and went
to the wood for the honey. When he had filled the cask he returned
home.</p>
<p>Meantime it had grown dark, and Petz crept noiselessly behind the
cart and crouched down under the peasant&rsquo;s window, saying to
herself, &ldquo;Just wait, you fellow, till I listen a
little!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Man brought the cask of honey into the house, and the children,
seeing the prize, crowded around the father with questions. &ldquo;O
little father, where did you get that honey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found it in the forest, dear children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the wife put in her word. &ldquo;Tell me, father, how did you
come by so much honey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the Man replied, &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t bother me! It was an old
trotter of a Bear that was chasing a little Hare and got stuck fast in
the cleft of a tree. Then I came along and helped her out of the
scrape, and for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span>thanks she showed me the hollow tree where the
honey was. So I brought it home. But it served her right, the lazy old
fat tramper; what business had she chasing a Hare?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Petz did not lose a word of all this, and she growled to
herself, &ldquo;Just wait once, wait! I&rsquo;ll be even with you with
a vengeance for jeering at me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went away home, and presently the Man, wife, and children all
went to bed. Early next morning the Man got up and went out to till his
field. He yoked his oxen, filled a sack with grain, put it and a plough
into the cart, and with a &ldquo;Gee-up, you oxen!&rdquo; set out for
his field, which lay on the edge of the forest. He was just about to
begin ploughing when Mrs. Petz came along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oho, cousin, so there you are! Didn&rsquo;t you promise me,
trust and true, not to say a word to mortal soul of what had happened
to me, and didn&rsquo;t you go home and tell the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name="pb44">44</a>]</span>whole
story to your wife and children? Hey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Man replied, &ldquo;Friend, what an idea! I haven&rsquo;t
said a word to any one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; interrupted the Bear. &ldquo;I was listening
under your window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Man thought to himself, &ldquo;Well, the cat is out of the
bag, sure enough. She knows the whole story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petz, &ldquo;it is all up with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now little Master Reinecke was listening to all this, and he rustled
in the bushes with his tail, and cried:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Man, Man!</p>
<p class="line">Wit in the head</p>
<p class="line">And a club in the hand!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">For, in fact, the <i>moujik</i> had a mighty ox-goad
in his hand, and he stood there quaking with fear of the enraged
She-bear, and trying to contrive how he should get <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span>out of
the scrape. Reinecke never stopped crying:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Man, Man!</p>
<p class="line">Wit in the head</p>
<p class="line">And a club in the hand!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">At this a bright thought struck the Man, and he
resolved to try his luck. So he poured the grain from his sack upon the
ground and said to Petz:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a pious Christian and have not yet prepared for death,
either by confession or penance. So do you, Mrs. Petz, step into this
sack, and as penance for all my sins I will carry you around the field,
heavy as you are. When I have gone around the field two or three times
with you on my back, you may do with me what you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious Heaven,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Petz, &ldquo;how high I
shall hold my head when people say that a man carried me around
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46</a>]</span>upon his shoulders!&rdquo; But scarcely had she
crawled into the sack when the Man tied it up tight and belabored her
head with his ox-goad until she gave up the ghost.</p>
<p>Then Reinecke stepped up to the Man and asked, &ldquo;And what am I
to get, Man, for the good counsel I gave you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I give you?&rdquo; asked the Man. &ldquo;Will you
have geese?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ducks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hens?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what the mischief do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to bite off your nose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this the man thought to himself, &ldquo;What the dickens! How
should I look going around without a nose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cold sweat broke out all over him, and he cried aloud in agony.
Reinecke heard him, and said, &ldquo;Oho, what does this
mean?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="figure xd21e1525width" id="p0046"><img src=

around the field</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name=
"pb47">47</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Man gave a second and a third cry; it startled the Master, and
he asked, &ldquo;Now what&rsquo;s all this about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing,&rdquo; replied the Man; &ldquo;only last evening
I fed nine hunting-dogs, and they are trying with all their might to
get out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Reinecke interrupted him: &ldquo;The cuckoo take your nose and
all the rest of you, only don&rsquo;t let your hunting-dogs come out
here until I have put my hide in safety!&rdquo; And away he went,
across lots and out of sight.</p>
<p>So the Man saved his nose, and full of joy he went home that night,
carrying Petz with him.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;Master Reinecke wasn&rsquo;t so clever that time,&rdquo; said
the little boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not always clever,&rdquo; said the grandmother.
&ldquo;But he was very clever when he took revenge on Isegrim.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name=

<p>&ldquo;Oh, tell me that, tell me that!&rdquo; cried the little
boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; said the grandmother. &ldquo;Did I not tell
you that I had not done my stint of spinning? Come this evening after
supper and I will tell you. Now run away home.&rdquo; <span class=

<p class="first">The little boy could hardly eat at supper-time, and as
soon as possible he ran to his grandmother&rsquo;s room. She was
knitting in the dark, for the stock of candles was getting low, and she
could knit without looking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you come for the story?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I was
expecting you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the little boy climbed to his place on the stove, and the
grandmother began the story of</p>

<h3 class="main">REINECKE&rsquo;S REVENGE ON ISEGRIM</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time Reinecke kneaded mud-cakes, baked
them, and spread them with honey. When they were all ready he betook
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name=
"pb50">50</a>]</span>himself to the turkey-tenders and begged them to
give him a turkey in exchange for his honey-cakes. The turkey-tenders
were not to be so easily hoaxed, and they sent him to the swine-herds,
assuring him that the swine-herds would give him a sucking pig for his
honey-cakes.</p>
<p>He therefore sought the swine-herds and begged for a sucking pig in
exchange for his cakes. The swine-herds would give him none, but sent
him to the cow-herds, who might give him a calf in exchange for the
cakes. So he went to the cow-herds and begged them to give him a calf
and take his honey-cakes in exchange.</p>
<p>The cow-herds declined, and sent him to the stable-boys, who would
surely give him a colt in exchange for the honey-cakes. So he went to
the stable-boys and offered to exchange his honey-cakes for a colt.
They gave him a beautiful colt and took in exchange the honey-cakes. So
Reinecke went <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name=
"pb51">51</a>]</span>away, leading the colt, and leaving with the
stable-boys a strict injunction on no account to break one of the cakes
until he should have disappeared behind a certain hill.</p>
<p>The stable-boys obeyed the behest, but when they afterward tried the
cakes and broke their teeth upon them, they perceived that they were
made of clay, and they at once set off in pursuit of the Fox. But
Master Reinecke had so much the start of them that they were obliged to
turn back, weary and overheated, having had their trouble for their
pains.</p>
<p>Now when Reinecke reached home he made a stall of wicker-work for
the colt, and devoted himself entirely to the care of him. Day after
day he brought him green, juicy grass and cool, refreshing drink, and
whenever he brought them he always called to the colt in these words:
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name=
"pb52">52</a>]</span></p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">O colt, tender little colt,</p>
<p class="line xd21e1584">Open the door for me!</p>
<p class="line">Juicy grass and cooling drink</p>
<p class="line xd21e1584">Bring I here for thee!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Then the colt would open the door. Reinecke gave the
colt very strict instructions on no account to open the door to any
other voice or words.</p>
<p>One day Isegrim came. He had often heard Reinecke call to the colt
to open the door, and now he began to call in his coarse voice:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">O colt, tender little colt,</p>
<p class="line xd21e1584">Open the door for me!</p>
<p class="line">Juicy grass and cooling drink</p>
<p class="line xd21e1584">Bring I here for thee!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">But the colt at once perceived that this was not
Reinecke&rsquo;s voice, and it did not stir to open the door.</p>
<p>Then Isegrim hid himself cunningly behind <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span>the
stable-wall to wait for a better chance.</p>
<p>Pretty soon along came Reinecke with grass and water. As soon as he
reached the stable he cried in his soft treble voice:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">O colt, tender little colt,</p>
<p class="line xd21e1584">Open the door for me!</p>
<p class="line">Juicy grass and cooling drink</p>
<p class="line xd21e1584">Bring I here for thee!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The colt recognized the voice, opened the door at
once, and began to tell how some one had been there and asked him to
open the door, but he had not opened because the voice sounded rough.
Upon this Reinecke said, &ldquo;On no account open the door to a rough
voice, but only to a soft one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day, when Reinecke was gone, along came Isegrim, who had
overheard the whole conversation from behind the stable-wall. He
crouched down as low as possible, and cried, in a very soft voice:
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name=
"pb54">54</a>]</span></p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">O colt, tender little colt,</p>
<p class="line xd21e1584">Open the door for me!</p>
<p class="line">Juicy grass and cooling drink</p>
<p class="line xd21e1584">Bring I here for thee!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The unhappy colt was deceived and opened the door.
Alas! Isegrim fell upon him, seized him by the throat, and ate him
up&mdash;all but the head and the tail, which he left lying there. Then
he made off, having closed the door behind him, that nothing might be
seen from without.</p>
<p>When Reinecke came home he began to call, as usual:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">O colt, tender little colt,</p>
<p class="line xd21e1584">Open the door for me!</p>
<p class="line">Juicy grass and cooling drink</p>
<p class="line xd21e1584">Bring I here for thee!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">But no one asked him in nor opened the door. So he
peeped in between the osiers, and when he saw nothing in the stall but
the colt&rsquo;s head and tail he knew all that had <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name="pb55">55</a>]</span>happened
and had not the least doubt as to who had brought this great misfortune
upon him. He tore the door open and set up a long, woe-begone howl.
Then he went out quite heart-broken and laid himself down in the road
for dead.</p>
<p>After a while a man came by in a wagon, and finding Reinecke in the
road he picked him up and threw him into the wagon, intending to strip
off his skin as soon as he reached home. Now this man had three cheeses
in a knapsack in his wagon, and presently Reinecke roused himself from
his feigned death, arose softly, stole the three cheeses out of the
knapsack, and made off. As soon as he had reached a safe distance he
devoured two of the cheeses and went on his way, holding the third
under his chin.</p>
<p>In the course of his travels he met friend Isegrim, who had eaten
his beloved colt. Isegrim no sooner saw Reinecke with the cheese than
his mouth began to water, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href=
"#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span>he asked him how he had come by it.
Then Reinecke, truthful as usual, replied that he had sucked it up out
of a brook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where may that brook be found?&rdquo; asked Isegrim
hastily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; answered Reinecke; &ldquo;I will lead you
to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now it happened that this meeting took place at the full of the
moon, about midnight, and a beautiful, star-bestrewn sky shed a magical
half-darkness over everything. Reinecke led Isegrim to a brook and,
showing him the reflection of the moon mirrored in the flowing water,
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see that great cheese there in the water? Now suck up
the water in great gulps and you will suck up the cheese at last, just
as I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So simple Isegrim sucked up the water in great gulps, until it began
to run out at his ears. Reinecke very kindly plugged up his ears and
cried to him: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name=
"pb57">57</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep on sucking, dear Isegrim; you&rsquo;ll soon have
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Simple Isegrim went at it again, and sucked until the water ran out
of his eyes. At once Reinecke stopped up his eyes, crying again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep on, dear Isegrim, you&rsquo;ll soon have it
now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Isegrim sucked on, until the water ran out at his nose. Then
Reinecke stopped up his nose and climbed upon his back, saying he was
sick and could not walk, and Isegrim must carry him.</p>
<p>The Wolf, in very woful plight, set out to carry the Fox, when
Reinecke tuned up and sang:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">The sick is carrying the well!</p>
<p class="line">The sick is carrying the well!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">And he kept on repeating the same words until Isegrim
asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;re singing, cousin?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name=
"pb58">58</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, nothing, dear Isegrim; they are only the fantasies
of illness!&rdquo; and he kept up his song:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">The sick is carrying the well!</p>
<p class="line">The sick is carrying the well!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">So it went on till they came to a house where a
wedding was being celebrated. When the wedding-guests heard
Reinecke&rsquo;s song they came out of the house and praised his
singing. Thereupon he said that he could sing a better song than that
if they would let him go into the house and up into the loft. To this
they agreed.</p>
<p>When Isegrim, with all the trouble in the world, had carried
Reinecke up into the loft, which was floored only with loose planks,
then Reinecke opened all the places he had plugged up, and the water
ran out of Isegrim&rsquo;s eyes and ears and nose and poured down
through the cracks upon the wedding-guests below. The guests ran nimbly
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=
"pb59">59</a>]</span>up into the loft, but Reinecke still more nimbly
made his escape through the window, while Isegrim was half-beaten to
death by the enraged wedding-guests and his body thrown out into the
road.</p>
<p>Then Reinecke came creeping back and taunted Isegrim. &ldquo;This
long time I have been wearing out shoe-leather to get the best of you,
because you ate up my colt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with these words away he went, leaving Isegrim to his fate.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;That served Isegrim right,&rdquo; said the little boy.
&ldquo;He had no business to eat up Reinecke&rsquo;s little
colt.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE SNOWY DAY</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The grandmother sat in her room spinning, and singing
a sad little song. Grandmother&rsquo;s songs were always sad, for that
is the way with the songs of the Russian peasant women, whose lives are
very hard. But the little boy had never heard any other kind, and he
was very fond of hearing his grandmother sing. He was lying on the
stove, watching her spin, for it was still snowing, and he was tired of
playing alone in the court. The snow was so deep now that none of the
mothers would let their little children go into the street. The big
children were all at work. Only little children play every day in
Russia. The big children work, except on holidays. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know any more stories about Master Reinecke, little
grandma?&rdquo; the little boy finally asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I do,&rdquo; replied the grandmother. &ldquo;Let me
see; did I ever tell you about</p>
<div id="ch7.1" class="div2 story"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#xd21e393">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">&ldquo;THE BIRD, THE FOX, AND THE DOG?&rdquo;</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the little boy. &ldquo;Do tell
that, please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the grandmother began:</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Once upon a time there was a Bird which built her nest in a hedge,
laid her eggs there, and began to brood over them. Now a little Fox got
wind of the matter, and he thought to himself, &ldquo;Aha!
there&rsquo;s a fine breakfast for me!&rdquo; So he left the Bird to
brood over her eggs, waiting for the time when the young ones should
hatch out.</p>
<p>When that time came he paid a visit to the Bird, which was singing
gayly in the hedge, and said to her: <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb62" href="#pb62" name="pb62">62</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-morning, dear cousin. Oh, how beautiful you are and how
sweet is your song! But still more enticing are your young ones in the
nest, and I mean to eat them up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little Bird answered, smiling, &ldquo;Ah, ah, you are not as
clever as I thought you, if you are thinking of eating these tiny
birds! They would not make you a mouthful. Just wait awhile till they
are grown; then come, and you may eat both them and me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the Bird appointed a day, and Reinecke went off in high glee,
whistling merrily.</p>
<p>In the meantime the Bird went to a Dog and promised him a delicious
meal&mdash;nothing other than Reinecke, in fact&mdash;telling him that
he had nothing to do but hide in the bushes on the appointed day, and
he could easily master the Master. The Dog smiled blissfully at the
news, saying: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name=
"pb63">63</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;This is what I call a stroke of luck! I&rsquo;ll tell you
what, little Bird, I&rsquo;ll hide in the bushes, and when Reinecke
comes, do you beg him to let you sing one last song. Then perch
yourself on a twig and sing out loud and clear. That shall be the
signal for me, and I will spring out of my ambush,
and&mdash;snap!&mdash;all will be over with Master Reinecke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the appointed day arrived Reinecke came gleefully along,
trolling this lay:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Fat little birds are right good cheer,</p>
<p class="line">So here I am, my Gossip dear!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Well, Gossip, how goes it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As well as possible,&rdquo; answered the little Bird.
&ldquo;What I have promised I will perform; I have only one last boon
to crave: let me sing my favorite song just once more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sing away, for all I care,&rdquo; answered Reinecke;
&ldquo;only make it short.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64"
href="#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span></p>
<p>So the little Bird perched herself upon a twig and began her song.
In a twinkling the Dog rushed out upon Reinecke, but the Master was on
the alert and took to flight, with the Dog close upon his heels. At
last Reinecke took refuge in a hole, while the Dog hid himself at the
entrance, keeping up a sharp lookout.</p>
<p>Then Reinecke began to talk to himself, and said to his feet:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my fine feet, how have you got on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finely,&rdquo; answered the feet; &ldquo;we did our very best
to outrun the Dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, good! You deserve all praise! And you, my good ears,
how did you behave yourselves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well; we listened most intently to know whether that
dreadful Dog was close behind us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! That was gallant! And how did you behave, my dear,
sweet eyes?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65"
name="pb65">65</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we spied around in every direction to discover the first
hole!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo! That was good of you.&rdquo; Then Reinecke looked at
his long tail and asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how is it with you, my beautiful, long, bushy
tail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the tail answered, &ldquo;Very badly; I am your steering rudder,
and you rushed along so unmercifully, dragging me through bush and
brier, that I am miserably scratched and torn. Really, I should not
have been worse off if the Dog had caught me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; cried Reinecke, in high displeasure, &ldquo;so
you are my open enemy, are you? All the others are faithful; you alone
would willingly have betrayed me. Out with you, out, my declared foe!
You shall no longer stay under the same roof with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Reinecke thrust his tail out of the hole. Snap!&mdash;the Dog had
it between his teeth, dragged the Fox out of his retreat, tore him
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name=
"pb66">66</a>]</span>in pieces, and was thus rewarded for all his
trouble. And the little birds were rid of their enemy.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;It was not nice of Reinecke to want to eat little
birds,&rdquo; said the little boy. &ldquo;I think he deserved to be
punished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He got off without punishment another time,&rdquo; observed
the grandmother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was that?&rdquo; asked the little boy eagerly.
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you tell me that story? Do! It is not
supper-time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it is not supper-time, and the story is a short
one,&rdquo; said the grandmother. &ldquo;So I will tell you about</p>

</div>
<div id="ch7.2" class="div2 story"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">&ldquo;THE FOX AND THE DOVE&rdquo;</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time there was a Dove which built her nest
in a high tree. Every year, about the time when her young ones were
beginning to get feathers, Reinecke would come along and say to the
Dove: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name=
"pb67">67</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me your young ones to eat; throw them down to me of your
own accord, or I will gobble you up as well as them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Dove, frightened at the threat, would throw down the young
birds. Thus it had happened year after year.</p>
<p>Now one day, as the Dove sat most melancholy upon her nest, a Great
Bird flew up and asked why she was so sad and down-cast. And the Dove
answered that it was because Reinecke would soon come and eat up her
young ones.</p>
<p>Upon this the Great Bird replied, &ldquo;Oh, you goose! Why do you
throw them down to him? Just bid your good friend to please give
himself the trouble to come after them. Then you&rsquo;ll soon see him
sneak away with his tail between his legs, for Reinecke cannot climb a
tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So when the time came round and Reinecke again presented himself,
the Dove said to him, &ldquo;If you want meat for dinner, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span>just be
so kind as to come up and help yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Fox saw that he must go away empty he asked the Dove who
had counselled her to speak thus, and she answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Great Bird that has a nest yonder near the
stream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reinecke at once betook himself to the stream and remonstrated with
that Great Bird for building his nest in so exposed a place, asking
what he did in case of a high wind.</p>
<p>The Great Bird answered, &ldquo;When the wind blows from the right I
turn to the left; when it blows from the left I turn to the
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what do you do when it blows from all sides?&rdquo; asked
the Fox.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I stick my head under my wing,&rdquo; said the Great
Bird, showing how he did it. But quick as a wink, when the Great
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name=
"pb69">69</a>]</span>Bird stuck his head under his wing, the Master
sprang upon him and seized him, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know how to give counsel to others, but not to advise
yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he ate him up.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The little boy pondered this story for a while. At last he said,
&ldquo;Grandmother, why did that Great Bird say that Reinecke could not
climb a tree? He has climbed a tree a great many times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one was not a story of this <i>mir</i>,&rdquo; replied
the grandmother. &ldquo;It is a story from another <i>mir</i>, where my
mother&rsquo;s mother was born. The foxes there are different.&rdquo;

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE ELECTION MEETING</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There were many men gathered in the little boy&rsquo;s
house, for the time of the <i>zemstvo</i> was drawing near, and the men
of the village must choose one of their number to go away to the large
city which was the capital of the district to help make laws for the
district. That is what the <i>zemstvo</i> is for. The noblemen go, of
course, and every village chooses one villager to go.</p>
<p>They met in the little boy&rsquo;s house to choose their delegate,
partly because the little boy&rsquo;s father was <i>starosta</i>, and
partly because his house was the largest. Though they were many, there
was room for them all on the bench of masonry that ran around the four
walls of the room, and was covered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71"
href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span>in the most honorable places
with bright calico. It was a very cold day, and the bench was as far as
possible from the stove, but they were not cold, for the chinks between
the upright boards which made the walls of the <i>starosta&rsquo;s</i>
house were well stopped with tow, and, besides, the men all had on
their warm <i>kaftans</i>, or over-blouses, and their fur-lined
boots.</p>
<p>There was a great deal of talking, and the little boy&rsquo;s mother
and sisters were very busy with the <i>samovar</i>, making tea and
handing it round. They had to be very careful to keep the water in the
<i>samovar</i> boiling madly, for tea is not good unless it scalds your
mouth. At least so they think in the little boy&rsquo;s village.</p>
<p>The little boy had been told that he must keep very still; but it is
as hard to keep a little Russian boy still as a little American boy,
for both are very fond of play. The little boy did not find it amusing,
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name=
"pb72">72</a>]</span>presently he crept very quietly toward the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; asked his mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To see grandmamma,&rdquo; answered the little boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful not to disturb her; she is busy,&rdquo; said the
mother.</p>
<p>The little boy ran quickly out of the room.</p>
<p>The grandmother was indeed busy. She had her short skirt turned
back, a short-handled broom of twigs in her hand, a great earthen jar
of water beside her, and she was hard at work scrubbing the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wipe your feet very clean,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and
don&rsquo;t bring dirt upon my nice floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little boy wiped his feet very clean, and tiptoed across to the
stove. It was really quite amusing to watch his grandmother scrub,
especially when the water made little pools in the hollows, worn by
many years of walking over the clay floor, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name="pb73">73</a>]</span>and she
had to flirt it out with little whisks of the broom. He watched her
very quietly until she had shaken out her broom and emptied the jar
into a great tub in the court. Then she came back and sank heavily into
her chair, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ouf! little grandmother is tired!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too tired to spin, little grandma!&rdquo; exclaimed the
little boy eagerly.</p>
<p>The grandmother smiled. &ldquo;But not too tired for a
story&mdash;is that what the little boy means?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re not, you&rsquo;re not!&rdquo; cried the
little boy gleefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Threefold,&rdquo; answered the Hedgehog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, how is that?&rdquo; asked the Fox.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you see, I have one sense above, one below, and the
third everywhere,&rdquo; replied the Hedgehog; and added, &ldquo;And
how manifold is your understanding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, mine is seventy-sevenfold,&rdquo; answered the Fox.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; said the Hedgehog.</p>
<p>Thereupon they walked along through the fields, and so eagerly were
they talking that they gave no heed to the way, and presently stumbled
into a Wolf&rsquo;s den. Then was good counsel precious! How should
they ever get out of this scrape?</p>
<p>Said Reinecke to the Hedgehog, &ldquo;Come now, search around in
your head-piece for a means of getting out of this pickle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have done that before,&rdquo; answered <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>the
Hedgehog, &ldquo;but I was afraid that by and by you would curse me.
How shall I, a little Hedgehog, with only a threefold understanding,
devise anything better than you, who have a seventy-sevenfold
understanding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, after talking back and forth a long time, the Hedgehog made
this suggestion, &ldquo;Say, Reinecke, just seize me by the ear and
throw me up out of the den, because I am the smaller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but how shall I get out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, just stick up your tail and I will pull you
out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Reinecke seized the Hedgehog by the ear and tossed him up out of
the den. Then he called upon him to keep his word. &ldquo;Hello there,
Gossip, now pull me out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what,&rdquo; answered the Hedgehog,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you something. I have only a threefold
understanding, and yet I found a way of helping myself. Now
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=
"pb76">76</a>]</span>do you help yourself with your seventy-sevenfold
understanding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time a <i>moujik</i> came along, and finding the Fox in the
den he made short work with him. But the Hedgehog crept away through
the thicket with his threefold understanding, while Reinecke, with all
his seventy-sevenfold understanding, was carried off by the
<i>moujik</i>.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;Reinecke was too proud of himself,&rdquo; said the little
boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a great sin to be proud,&rdquo; observed the
grandmother. &ldquo;The <i>pop</i> said so on Sunday in
church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a pause. Then the little boy said coaxingly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are tired yet, little grandmother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>was</i> a short story,&rdquo; replied the grandmother,
patting the little boy on the shoulder, &ldquo;and grandmother is a

<p>The Cock, quite willing, stretched out his neck and began to crow,
when in a trice Reinecke pounced upon him and seized him by the

to God, who has sent you so good a meal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Reinecke fell into the Cock&rsquo;s trap, for he stood upon his

<h3 class="main">THE DISAPPOINTED BEAR</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time a little old woman, who was walking
in the forest, climbed up into a wild-cherry tree to gather cherries.
Now a Bear espied her, and he came under the tree and cried,
&ldquo;Come down, old woman, that I may eat you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go along with you!&rdquo; answered the old woman. &ldquo;Why
should you eat a scrawny old woman like me? Here, gnaw upon my shoe
till I come down, and I will take you <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb79" href="#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span>to my house; I have two
little children there, named Janko and Mirko; they will make you a
right savory dish. So have patience till you get them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So said the little old woman and threw down one of her shoes. Master
Petz gnawed and gnawed upon it, but the more he gnawed the hungrier he
grew. Greatly enraged, he screamed up to the old woman:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come down, you old wench, and let me eat you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just wait a little longer, till the old wench has gathered
enough cherries,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Here, gnaw this other shoe
awhile; she&rsquo;ll soon come down and show you the way to her
house.&rdquo; So saying, she threw down the other shoe.</p>
<p>When Petz found that the second shoe was no juicier than the first
he made no further effort, but contented himself with thinking of the
fat little children at the old woman&rsquo;s house. When she had
gathered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name=
"pb80">80</a>]</span>cherries enough, down she came and went home, the
Bear tramping along behind her.</p>
<p>When they reached the house the old woman said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
tell you what, first let me give the children a good supper, that they
may be all the fatter; and meanwhile do you run about till evening to
get up a better appetite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Petz went away and ran about in the woods all the rest of the
day, and at evening he came back to the hut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here I am, little mother!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;now bring
out Janko and Mirko, and see me polish them off. I am starving to
death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; answered the little old woman from within,
&ldquo;Janko has made the door fast with bolts, and I have just put
Mirko to sleep. I couldn&rsquo;t think of waking him. And little mother
is so old and weak that she can&rsquo;t unbolt the door alone. Come
some other day.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81"

<p>Then Master Petz perceived that he had been fooled, and he walked

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h2 class="main">CAT AND DOG</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The little boy was playing in the court with the
<i>moujik&rsquo;s</i> dog that helped to guard the sheep. It was a
clear, cold day, but the little boy was not cold, for he had on his
warm quilted <i>kaftan</i>, or blouse, his cap, which he called his
<i>chapka</i>, on his head, and on his feet were sandals made of the
tough bark of the linden-tree. He was not going to risk frozen toes
another time!</p>
<p>The sheep-dog was old and rather cross, but he was always kind to
the little boy. But when the house-cat followed the cow-herd woman out
of the house, where she had gone to carry some milk, the dog bristled
up and growled. The cat spat at him, and this was too much. He sprang
at her, but kitty <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83"
name="pb83">83</a>]</span>was too quick for him. She flew across the
court and scrambled nimbly up to the shed roof by one of the supporting
poles. The dog was too old and heavy to follow her, and he sat on his
haunches in the court below, bristling and snarling, the cat spitting
back at him and evidently enjoying the fun. The cow-herd woman and a
<i>moujik</i> who was at work in the court were laughing heartily; the
little boy&rsquo;s brother, who was cutting wood in the shed, came out
to see what it was all about. The little boy was highly excited, and he
ran to call his grandmother to come and see.</p>
<p>But by the time the grandmother had risen slowly from her
chair&mdash;for her rheumatism was bad that day&mdash;and had gone to
the door, leaning on her stick, the fun was all over. The cat had gone
around to another side of the shed, and lay basking in the sun, out of
the dog&rsquo;s sight; the <i>moujik</i>, the cow-herd woman, and the
little boy&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84"
name="pb84">84</a>]</span>brother had gone back to their work. Only the
dog remained, looking up at the deserted roof and growling at
nothing.</p>
<p>The little boy went with his grandmother into the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandmamma,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;why does the dog always
quarrel with the cat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My great-grandmother told me why,&rdquo; replied the
grandmother. &ldquo;I will tell you that story now, if you
like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do, do!&rdquo; cried the little boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the story,&rdquo; said the grandmother, &ldquo;of</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">&ldquo;WHY THE DOG CANNOT ENDURE THE CAT, NOR THE CAT
THE MOUSE&rdquo;</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In olden times, as my great-grandmother told me, dogs
enjoyed great freedom, and among other privileges they had a right to
all the meat that fell from the table. To guard this right for all time
they drew up a manifesto, and copied it upon parchment. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span>In this
manifesto this right was expressly made known. For a long time the King
of the Dogs had charge of this document, but finally he confided it to
the care of his private secretary, the Tomcat. And the Tomcat carried
the proclamation up into the garret and hid it behind a beam where no
one could possibly find it.</p>
<p>Now it happened that behind the beam dwelt a young Mouse, and on one
of his walks he stumbled upon the roll. He tried to drag it from its
hiding-place, but the stiff parchment stuck fast, and he could not pull
it out. But it was quite within reach of his little teeth, and the
Mouse was highly delighted with his lucky find, for now he had
something to nibble upon. Day by day he paid a visit to the parchment
and whetted his teeth upon it.</p>
<p>Now it presently happened that one day a Dog picked up a piece of
meat and was caught and his paw well rubbed with hot <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span>ashes.
Weeping, he appeared before the King and told him the whole story.</p>
<p>Then the King immediately summoned his private secretary, the
Tomcat, and commanded him to show the proclamation. The Tomcat hastened
to bring the parchment without delay; but, to his misfortune, what did
he find? Only a few fragments!</p>
<p>It was at once clear to him that this was the deed of some little
Mouse. He told the story to all the other Cats, who, to express their
grief and sorrow, began to mew most piteously. When they had
sufficiently expressed their feelings they declared war against all
Mice.</p>
<p>After this the Tomcat made his report to the King of the Dogs, and
the King immediately summoned the Dog-<i>zemstvo</i>. The Dogs came
together from all parts&mdash;sheep-dogs, wolf-dogs, boar-hounds,
house-dogs; and to them all the King gave command that from thenceforth
and forever <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name=
"pb87">87</a>]</span>they should treat the Cat as the common enemy.
Thus all cats would be made to rue that Tomcat&rsquo;s
carelessness.</p>
<p>And that is the end of the story.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;Now I understand all about it,&rdquo; said the little boy.

<h2 class="main">A PLEASANT SURPRISE</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A very delightful surprise awaited the little boy. A
few days after the meeting in his house his mother told him that the
<i>mir</i> had elected his father deputy to the <i>zemstvo</i>. In a
few days he must go to the capital of the district, and he had decided
to take the little boy and his mother with him. That was news indeed!
The little boy ran to tell his grandmother. Or, rather, he hopped on
one foot all the way, for he was so glad that he had to do something
unusual.</p>
<p>The grandmother was delighted with the news. &ldquo;You will go on
the railroad,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That is a great thing. There were
no railroads when I was young, and I should <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span>not like
to travel on one. A good sledge with three horses is far safer, I
think. But the railroad is faster, your father tells me, and that is
something in cold weather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little boy ran back to find out how soon they were to go.
&ldquo;Shall we go to-day?&rdquo; he asked his mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, not to-day!&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to-morrow, but perhaps the day after
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a long time!&rdquo; sighed the little boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have patience,&rdquo; said the mother. &ldquo;There
is no virtue so necessary in this world as patience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little boy wandered back to his grandmother&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandmamma,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;mother says I must have
patience; but I don&rsquo;t know how. We are not going to start on the
journey for two whole days.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90"
href="#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I can help you,&rdquo; said the grandmother.
&ldquo;If I were to tell you a story now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, that would help, little grandma!&rdquo; cried the
little boy. &ldquo;I can be very patient when you tell me
stories.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">&ldquo;THE FOX AND THE BADGER&rdquo;</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A Fox and a Badger met in the mountains and made an
alliance, agreeing that whichever of them found anything good to eat
should share it with the other, like a brother.</p>
<p>Now the Master knew where there was a trap set and baited with a
great piece of meat. He therefore led the Badger there and showed him
the meat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, dear nephew,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;how your clever
uncle has led you to a place where we can both have a grand feast. But
you are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name=
"pb91">91</a>]</span>more limber than I, so just slip gently in and
pull out the meat, while I keep watch that the <i>moujik</i> who put it
here does not suddenly catch us napping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Badger agreed without further words. He slipped into the trap,
and was about to pull the meat from the hook,
when&mdash;snap!&mdash;his forefoot was fast in the trap. The Badger
broke out into a howl of distress, &ldquo;Help, uncle, help! I am
lost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reinecke ran quickly to the trap, but instead of freeing the Badger
he at once began to gnaw the meat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just have a little patience,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;till I
have eaten this morsel before some one comes from the village. Then I
will pull your leg out of the trap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Graybeard saw plainly that the Master had played a trick upon
him, and he quickly seized him by the nape of the neck. At this moment
the <i>moujik</i> came <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92"
name="pb92">92</a>]</span>running up, crying from afar, &ldquo;Hold on,
my falcon-badger! By my faith, I will not rumple a hair of your
head!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the <i>moujik</i> killed the Fox and stripped off his skin,
saying to the Badger, &ldquo;You may go free; his skin is worth five
<i>kopeks</i>, but yours only two. Go, in God&rsquo;s name!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t fair of Reinecke,&rdquo; observed the little
boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it wasn&rsquo;t fair, and so he got punished,&rdquo; said
the grandmother.</p>
<p>The little boy was silent for a few minutes. Then he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little grandma, I am not patient yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; said the grandmother, &ldquo;if my stories
don&rsquo;t help you to be patient, there is no use in my telling
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they do help, grandmamma,&rdquo; said the little boy.
&ldquo;I am a little patient now, just a very little. If you told me
another story I should be more patient still.&rdquo; <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A Stag and a Hedgehog were once standing upon a steep
hill, and the Hedgehog invited the Stag to roll down with him into the
ditch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you roll down first,&rdquo; replied the Stag.</p>
<p>Without further words the Hedgehog rolled himself into a round ball
and rolled down the slope. The Stag followed and broke his neck.</p>
<p>Then thought the Hedgehog, &ldquo;What shall I do with you
now?&rdquo; At last the thought occurred to him to call a butcher, and
he immediately set out to seek one. On the way he met a Fox.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whither away?&rdquo; asked Reinecke; and the Hedgehog
answered, &ldquo;To seek a butcher.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name="pb94">94</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Gossip,&rdquo; said the Fox, &ldquo;I am a
butcher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then show me your teeth, Master,&rdquo; said the
Hedgehog.</p>
<p>Reinecke showed his teeth, but the Hedgehog told him they were not
sharp enough, and went on his way.</p>
<p>After a while he met a Wolf, who asked him, &ldquo;Whither away,
Gossip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To seek a butcher,&rdquo; said the Hedgehog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a butcher, sure enough,&rdquo; said the Wolf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then show me your tools.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isegrim showed his teeth, and the Hedgehog, well pleased, said to
him, &ldquo;Follow me, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Wolf followed him, and they came to the dead Stag. In a trice
the Wolf had torn him in pieces, and inviting all his kindred to the
feast, he gave each of them a fine morsel, and kept a whole leg for
himself, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>without the least consideration for the
Hedgehog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, and what am I to get?&rdquo; asked the Hedgehog, quite
vexed; and the Wolf replied, &ldquo;The entrails.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This seemed to the Hedgehog very unfair, and he began to reason with
Isegrim. But the Wolf only answered, &ldquo;If you aren&rsquo;t
satisfied, go to the judge and make a complaint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the Hedgehog went to seek a judge, and the Wolf followed after.
Now the Hedgehog knew where there was a trap, and he led Isegrim in
that direction. The Hedgehog tapped lightly upon the knocker, but this
quite disgusted Isegrim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, let me knock!&rdquo; said he, and he thumped with all
the strength of his paw. So he was caught, and the Hedgehog ran away
laughing.</p>

<div class="divBody">

years in peace and quietness with his wife. At last, however, they fell
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name=

bed and board and to divide their goods between them.</p>
<p><i>Short hair is soon brushed</i>, and the division was soon made,
for their whole possessions consisted of a Cock and a Hen. And the wife
said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the Hen for my share, and you may have the
Cock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By and by the husband fell ill, and he went to beg his wife to give
him just one little egg, for he was very hungry. But she answered him
scornfully:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum, hum, where is your Cock? Let him lay you a little egg;
if he won&rsquo;t do it, kill him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this the man returned home quite crestfallen, and said to his
Cock, &ldquo;Come, my fine fellow, this can&rsquo;t go on any longer!
You do nothing but eat and drink, and never bring me so much as a
bright penny. Go out into the world and seek your fortune!&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=
"pb99">99</a>]</span></p>
<p>In deep dejection the Cock sighed, &ldquo;Ah, where shall I find
anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, he sallied forth sturdily, and in the forest he met
Isegrim. The Wolf said to him, &ldquo;Whither away, my fine
fellow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m going out into the world to seek my
fortune!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I go with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not another word; be my comrade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the two travelled up and down the world until Isegrim was too
tired to go another step, and the Cock said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, dear uncle, can&rsquo;t you walk farther than
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, no!&rdquo; said the Wolf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then slip yourself into me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a trice Isegrim was in the body of the Cock, who went on, quite
at his ease.</p>
<p>Shortly after he met Reinecke, and said to him, &ldquo;Whither away,
Master?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whither away? Into the world to seek my fortune.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name=
"pb100">100</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Then join my company,&rdquo; said the Cock.</p>
<p>So they went up and down the world until Reinecke was quite
exhausted and could go no farther.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, Master!&rdquo; said the Cock, &ldquo;do you give out so
soon? Well, just slip yourself into me and I&rsquo;ll carry
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Reinecke slipped quickly into the Cock, who bravely went on
his way.</p>
<p>After a time he came to a little Brook. &ldquo;Little Brook, whither
away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, through the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me, then, and be my comrade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they went forward until the little Brook, for very weariness,
could go no farther.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does your strength give out so soon, my little Brook?&rdquo;
asked the Cock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, yes!&rdquo; replied the little Brook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then slip into me; I&rsquo;ll carry you,&rdquo; and in a
moment the Brook had slipped into the Cock. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name="pb101">101</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the course of time the Cock met a swarm of Bees. &ldquo;Whither
away?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, into the wide world to seek a shelter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then come along; be my comrades.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had not gone far before the swarm of Bees grew tired and could
go no farther, and the Cock invited them to crawl into his body.</p>
<p>So the Cock, carrying the swarm of Bees, the Brook, the Fox, and the
Wolf in his body, arrived at a great city. In this city reigned a King
and his wife, the Queen. The Cock flew straight to the roof of the
royal palace and spent the night there. At early dawn he began to crow
lustily:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Cock-a-doodle-doo! Cock-a-doodle-doo!</p>
<p class="line">One kick for the King, for the Queen two!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">This enraged the King terribly, and he commanded his
chamberlain to catch this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href=
"#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span>impudent crower and chain him in
the royal stables, that he might be trampled to death by the
horses&rsquo; hoofs. The chamberlain caught the Cock, threw him into
the stable, and shut the door well.</p>
<p>Then the Cock told the Wolf to slip out, and during the night
Isegrim strangled all the horses and ate up a whole colt. Then he broke
a hole through the wall, by which he and the Cock escaped. The Cock
perched himself again upon the roof and began his song of
yesterday:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Cock-a-doodle-doo! Cock-a-doodle-doo.</p>
<p class="line">One kick for the King, for the Queen two!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">In a moment the King sprang out of bed, called his
chamberlain, and ordered him to send and see what had happened in the
stable, that the Cock was out of doors and crowing. The chamberlain
hastened to the stable, saw the strangled horses, and brought the news
to the King. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name=
"pb103">103</a>]</span></p>
<p>At this the King flew into a still greater rage, and gave command to
catch the Cock and throw him among the geese. The chamberlain seized
the Cock and locked him in the goose-pen, where there were several
hundred geese. Then the Cock said to the Fox, &ldquo;Come forth,
Master, and finish up with all these geese!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reinecke was soon at work, and by daybreak every goose was
strangled. Then the Fox groped a hole through the pen, and he and the
Cock slipped comfortably out. The Cock flew again to the roof and sang
as on the former day:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Cock-a-doodle-doo! Cock-a-doodle-doo!</p>
<p class="line">One kick for the King, for the Queen two!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The King was more enraged than ever, and sent to see
what had happened to the geese. The servant found them all dead, and
brought the news to the King. Then the King commanded that the great
bake-oven <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name=
"pb104">104</a>]</span>should be heated and the Cock thrown into it.
The servant caught the Cock and threw him into the very middle of the
hot oven. Then the Cock sang:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Little Brook, flow quickly out;</p>
<p class="line">Put the oven fire out!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">And the little Brook flowed out into the oven and
extinguished the whole fire.</p>
<p>The next morning the people came to see if the Cock was dead, when,
lo! he was already perched upon the roof, singing:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Cock-a-doodle-doo! Cock-a-doodle-doo!</p>
<p class="line">One kick for the King, for the Queen two!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Now the King was beside himself with rage. He rushed
out to catch the Cock himself, and not knowing, in his excitement, what
to do with him, he thrust him under his night-clothes. Then the Cock
told the swarm of Bees to come out and sting the King. &ldquo;Buzz,
buzz!&rdquo; out they came, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href=
"#pb105" name="pb105">105</a>]</span>and stung the King till he was all
one wound.</p>
<p>At this the King commanded his servants to lock up the Cock in his
treasure-chamber, that he might miserably starve to death. The servants
seized the Cock and carried him to the treasure-chamber, but they were
so frightened that they ran away as fast as their heels could carry
them, forgetting to fasten the door. There were great heaps of shining,
brand-new ducats in the treasure-chamber, and the Cock made the best of
the opportunity by swallowing a number of them and hiding one under
each of his feathers. Then he flew away to his old master&rsquo;s
house. He perched upon a tree in the yard and began to crow:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line xd21e1584">O, little father, little father!</p>
<p class="line">Spread some plates abroad for me,</p>
<p class="line">I&rsquo;ll give ducats bright to thee!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The old man, overjoyed, spread out three <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span>plates under the tree. Then the Cock shook
himself, and a shower of golden ducats fell and lay upon the plates in
three great heaps. The old man was perfectly happy to have so much
money, and from this time forward he let the Cock want for nothing.</p>
<p>His former wife soon heard that he had become enormously rich, and
she came to see him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, come,&rdquo; said she to him, &ldquo;give me a few
ducats!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if I know it! Why would not you give me one little egg,
eh? Go back and tell your old Hen to bring you ducats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman ran back to her home and commanded her Hen, &ldquo;Go
out into the world and seek your fortune, and bring me home some
ducats.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="figureHead">A shower of golden ducats fell, and lay upon the
plates in three great heaps</p>
</div>
<p>The Hen went sadly forth, betook herself to the refuse heap and
began to scratch in the litter. After long scratching she found a
copper <i>heller</i> and a needle. She <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb107" href="#pb107" name="pb107">107</a>]</span>picked them up, and
also stuck a little stone under each of her feathers. Then she flew
back to the court-yard and began to cackle:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line xd21e1584">O, little mother, little mother!</p>
<p class="line">Spread some plates abroad for me,</p>
<p class="line">I&rsquo;ll give ducats bright to thee!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Filled with joy, the old woman hastened to spread out
four plates under the tree. Then the Hen shook herself, and let fall on
one plate the worn <i>heller</i>, but only little stones on all the
others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; exclaimed the old woman angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, here is something more,&rdquo; clucked the Hen, and she
slung the needle into the old woman&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p>Upon this the old woman beat the Hen soundly, and went back to her
husband&rsquo;s house, begged his pardon and made it all up with him.
Whenever he wanted an egg <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href=
"#pb108" name="pb108">108</a>]</span>she gave him one, and he always
gave her a ducat in exchange.</p>
<p>Little boy, if you are good you shall get an egg for nothing!</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;I am good, grandmother,&rdquo; said the little boy.
&ldquo;Will you give me an egg?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The grandmother laughed. &ldquo;That is only the way the story
ends,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But it is dinner-time, and if your mother
will let you take dinner with me I will give you an egg. Run away and
ask her.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109"

<h2 class="main">THE SHEEP-PLAY</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The dinner was over, the plates washed and put away,
and grandmother was busy with her spinning. The little boy was amusing
himself with some bits of wool that had fallen to the floor, for
everything is a plaything to a Russian child. The bits of wool were
sheep, and a wooden stool was a sheepfold, and a bit of fuel that had
fallen when grandmother covered up the fire was the sheep-dog. It was a
very nice play.</p>
<p>The room was very quiet, for, though the little boy talked all the
time to his sheep and his dog, he had been taught to talk softly in his
plays, as all children must do when a whole family lives in one room.
He talked very softly indeed when he saw that grandmother <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name="pb110">110</a>]</span>had
leaned her head against the straight back of her rush-bottomed chair
and was taking a little nap. Presently the distaff fell from her lap to
the floor and awakened her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I must have been asleep!&rdquo; she said, and went on
with her spinning.</p>
<p>At last the sheep, which had been wandering away upon the hills that
rose between the hollows in the clay floor, had all been discovered by
the sheep-dog and herded, one by one, in the fold. The little boy was
tired of playing, and he sat on the stool to listen to his
grandmother&rsquo;s singing. Grandmother was always singing when she
was not telling stories to the little boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you tell stories while you spin, as well as
when you knit?&rdquo; asked the little boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that isn&rsquo;t the way!&rdquo; said the grandmother.
&ldquo;When it is dark and I take my knitting I can tell a story, but
not now. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name=
"pb111">111</a>]</span>You&rsquo;d better go home till it begins to
grow dark; then come, and we&rsquo;ll see what story little grandmother
can tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The winter day was very short, and it was not long before the little
boy came back. Grandmother was still spinning, but she laid aside her
distaff and spindle, took her knitting down from the shelf, and began
the story of</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">THE BEG AND THE FOX</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time there lived in a certain village a
Beg whose whole property consisted of a horse, a greyhound, and a
musket. He had no other occupation than hunting, and by this he gained
his living.</p>
<p>One fine day he mounted his horse, threw his musket over his
shoulder, called to his greyhound, and set off to hunt upon the high
mountains. After riding a long distance he reached an elevated plain,
where he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=
"pb112">112</a>]</span>tied his horse to a tree and went forward into
the thick woods, with his gun upon his shoulder and his dog by his
side. While he was hunting on the mountain a Fox drew near to the horse
and lay down in the grass beside him.</p>
<p>The Beg hunted about in the woods for a long time, but he only made
out to kill a single deer. When he went back to his horse and saw the
Fox lying there beside it he was astonished, and raised his musket to
make an end of the Master. But when the Fox saw what the Beg was about
to do he sprang up quickly and implored him, for the love of Heaven, to
spare his life, promising to be a faithful guard and protector to his
horse.</p>
<p>The Beg took pity on the Fox and gave him his life. Then mounting
his horse, he laid the deer before him, set the Fox behind him, and
went home. On arriving at home he put the deer upon the spit to roast
for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name=
"pb113">113</a>]</span>supper, and threw the offal to the Fox, that he
might have a good meal too.</p>
<p>So the night passed. In the first dawn of morning the Beg again set
out, taking the Fox along. He went again to the same high plain, tied
his horse to the same tree, and went forward to hunt, leaving the Fox
to guard the horse. After his departure the Fox remained alone for a
time. But he soon had company, for a Bear came along, intending to
devour the horse. But the Fox stopped him and begged him to spare the
horse, advising him to stay till the Beg returned, for he was a good
master and would feed them both at his house. The Bear joyfully
accepted this proposal, and lay down beside the Fox to await the worthy
Beg&rsquo;s return.</p>
<p>When the Beg came back from hunting he was not a little surprised to
see the Bear lying peacefully with the Fox beside the horse, and he
quickly raised his musket to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href=
"#pb114" name="pb114">114</a>]</span>him. But the Fox sprang forward
and began to beseech the Beg to spare the Bear and take him home with
him. The Bear, he said, would keep him company in guarding the horse,
and would rush to the Beg&rsquo;s aid in every need and danger. At
these entreaties the Beg laid down his gun, threw across his horse the
two deer which he had killed, and returned home in high good-humor,
accompanied by the Fox and the Bear.</p>
<p>The following day the Beg went hunting again and left his horse on
the same high plain. This day a Wolf joined the company and was taken
home with the others. On the fourth day a Mouse and a Mole presented
themselves and were accepted in the family, and at last came the bird
Kumrikusha,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2527src" href="#xd21e2527" name=
"xd21e2527src">1</a> which was so large that it could easily have
carried away the horse and his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115"
href="#pb115" name="pb115">115</a>]</span>rider through the air. All
these animals were fed by the Beg at his own house.</p>
<p>One day the Fox said to the Bear, &ldquo;Up, Master Petz! Bring me
here a log! I will sit upon it and give orders, and you must all
execute them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon this the Bear betook himself to the forest and dragged home the
trunk of a mighty tree. Then Reinecke climbed upon it and uttered the
following discourse:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right! Well, then! See here, now, worthy companions and
friends! We must marry our Beg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; replied the others; &ldquo;but how shall we
begin? For we don&rsquo;t know where to find a maiden for
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Emperor has a daughter,&rdquo; replied Reinecke;
&ldquo;let us marry our Beg to her. Kumrikusha, do you begin. Set off
at once for the imperial castle, lie in wait for the young lady when
she takes her walk, seize her and bring her here.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name="pb116">116</a>]</span></p>
<p>Kumrikusha, nothing loath, set out at once, alighted near the
imperial castle, and watched for the Emperor&rsquo;s little daughter.
Just at nightfall she came out of the castle to walk, accompanied by
her waiting-woman. In a trice Kumrikusha was upon the spot, seized the
Princess, set her upon his back, and flew homeward.</p>
<p>When the Emperor heard of the abduction of his daughter he was
beside himself with grief, and offered to reward with untold wealth the
person who should bring her home again. But all in vain, for no one
dared undertake the adventure, until at last, one day, a gypsy-wife
presented herself before the Emperor and said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord Emperor, what shall I get if I bring you back your
daughter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Emperor could hardly believe his own ears, and he cried out in
delight, &ldquo;Ask what you will, it shall be granted; only bring her
back safe!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117"
name="pb117">117</a>]</span></p>
<p>The gypsy-wife went home, took some beans in her hand, and began to
practise enchantment with them, according to ancient custom. She soon
divined from the beans that the Princess was distant ten days&rsquo;
journey, and she at once prepared to follow her. She took a piece of
carpet and her riding-whip, seated herself upon the carpet, cracked the
whip, and up rose the carpet into the air. It carried her straight to
the place where the Beg was living with his wife, the Emperor&rsquo;s
daughter.</p>
<p>Arrived within a short distance of the Beg&rsquo;s stronghold, the
gypsy-wife let herself down to the ground, left her carpet and
riding-whip lying there, and found a hiding-place where she could see
the Princess when she came out before the door for her evening walk.
She had not long to wait. The Princess soon came out for a little walk,
and in a trice the gypsy-wife was at her <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb118" href="#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span>side, entering into
conversation with her. As they talked she gradually led her farther and
farther away from the Beg&rsquo;s castle, and at last turned off into a
by-path, where the carpet lay.</p>
<p>No sooner did the Princess see the carpet spread upon the grass than
she exclaimed, &ldquo;Why, here is a carpet! Let us sit down upon
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing could have pleased the gypsy better. They sat down together.
The gypsy took up her riding-whip, struck the carpet, and away they
both went through the air, straight to the imperial castle.</p>
<p>The Emperor&rsquo;s joy was boundless when he saw his daughter, and
he richly rewarded the gypsy. But he shut the Princess up in a room and
strictly forbade her to leave it, appointing two maids to watch and
wait upon her.</p>
<p>When Reinecke heard what had happened to his Beg&rsquo;s wife, he
summoned his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span>companions to a council and addressed them in
the following words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friends and comrades! We have indeed married our Beg to the
Emperor&rsquo;s daughter, but, as you see, she has been forcibly taken
away from us, and here is our Beg a lonely bachelor again. Nothing
remains for us to do but to bring the Princess back to our Beg. But
this is an undertaking beset with difficulties. The Emperor keeps his
daughter under strict watch, and never permits her to leave her
chamber. You see, therefore, that only stratagem can avail us
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, then, shall we do?&rdquo; asked Petz.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing better to do than for me to transform myself
into a beautiful striped kitten and play about under the
Princess&rsquo;s window. When she sees me she will send her maids down
to catch me. But I shall not allow myself to be caught until the
Princess herself comes down. At the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb120" href="#pb120" name="pb120">120</a>]</span>very moment she
appears, do you, Kumrikusha, arrive upon the scene, seize her, and
carry her to our Beg. Meanwhile I shall look sharp to outrun the
pursuers and get off with a whole skin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus spoke the Master, and all the others agreed that the plan was
good.</p>
<p>The bird Kumrikusha immediately took the Fox under his wing, flew
with him into the kingdom where the Emperor&rsquo;s daughter
languished, and set him down near the imperial castle. The Master no
sooner felt solid ground under his feet than he transformed himself
into a beautiful striped kitten, crept under the balcony where the
Princess was sitting, and began to spring about in the most graceful
and fantastic manner. Thus he succeeded in attracting her attention,
and, as he had anticipated, the Princess at once sent her maids down to
bring the kitten to her. But Reinecke, though in a cat&rsquo;s form,
was still a fox at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121"
name="pb121">121</a>]</span>heart, and was not to be caught at any
price.</p>
<p>When the Emperor&rsquo;s daughter saw this she herself went down to
catch Pussy. But hardly had she stepped out of the door when the bird
Kumrikusha swooped down, seized her, and bore her home to the Beg,
while Reinecke ran off in another direction and thus saved his
skin.</p>
<p>As soon as the Emperor heard of this mishap he ordered out his
hounds to hunt the cat that had decoyed away his daughter. But the cat,
when he saw himself chased, took refuge in the cleft of a rock into
which the hounds could not follow him. So they returned home from a
bootless chase.</p>
<p>Then the cat crept out, transformed himself back into a fox, and
followed Kumrikusha, who by this time had brought the Princess home to
the Beg.</p>
<p>The Emperor, convinced that he should not recover his daughter by
peaceful means, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122"
name="pb122">122</a>]</span>levied an immense army and declared war
against the beasts. When Reinecke heard of this he summoned the other
animals that lived with the Beg, and which, as I have told you, were a
Bear, a Wolf, a Mouse, a Mole, and the bird Kumrikusha, and spoke to
them thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen! The Emperor, with his whole army, is marching against
us to exterminate us. Very well; let us also summon our forces, that we
may make a brave stand against him. Master Petz, how many bears can you
muster?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than three hundred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, Isegrim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can bring five hundred wolves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, Mouse&mdash;speak up; how great is your
command?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can bring three thousand mice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how many moles can you bring, Mole?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight thousand.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123"
href="#pb123" name="pb123">123</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, Kumrikusha, will you join us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, with two or three hundred birds like myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! Now go and levy your forces as has been agreed. When
they are assembled, come here, that I may tell you what to do
next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as Reinecke had given these orders the beasts all betook
themselves to the forest in order to summon their troops. Soon heaven
and earth resounded with the din of approaching multitudes. Here came
the army of the Bears, there came the Wolves, and close behind were the
Mice and the Moles. Woods and fields were filled with them, and when
they were all drawn up in martial array Reinecke held a review and gave
the following orders:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, Bears and Wolves, must lead the van, and when the
Emperor has encamped for the night do you fall upon the camp
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name=
"pb124">124</a>]</span>and kill all the horses. On the second night,
you, Mice, must gnaw all the saddles, for they will have procured fresh
horses in the meantime. On the third night, you, Moles, must dig around
the camp a subterranean passage fifteen ells broad and twenty deep. And
as soon as the army is stirring in the morning, you, Kumrikushas, must
rain down great pieces of rock upon them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The review ended, the several detachments of the army of the beasts
set forth. The first night, when the imperial host had encamped, the
Bears and the Wolves fell upon the imperial horses and tore them all to
pieces. Early in the morning the soldiers announced to the Emperor that
wild beasts had killed all the horses during the night. The Emperor
made diligent search into the cause of the sudden calamity, and
meanwhile he commanded that fresh horses should be procured without
delay. This was done and the army moved on. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name="pb125">125</a>]</span></p>
<p>During the second night&rsquo;s encampment the Mice came and gnawed
all the trappings of the horses. In the morning when the soldiers awoke
and saw that all the saddles were nibbled they told the Emperor, who at
once commanded that new ones should be made. This done, again the army
marched on.</p>
<p>The third night the Fox sent the Moles to surround the camp with a
subterranean passage fifteen ells broad and twenty deep. That the work
might be the sooner accomplished, he directed the Bears to carry away
the loosened earth. The Moles began the work about midnight, leaving
only one hole open at one side where the earth was to be carried out.
While the Moles were digging under the ground and throwing up the
clods, the Bears were busily carrying the earth to some distance from
the camp.</p>
<p>When the Emperor&rsquo;s troops awoke in the morning they mounted
their horses to ride <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126"
name="pb126">126</a>]</span>away; but hardly had they gone a few steps
when they began to fall through the treacherous earth. At the same time
the Kumrikushas let fall a rain of rocks and stones upon them.</p>
<p>When the Emperor saw his great army thus miserably perishing he
cried aloud, &ldquo;Let us beat a retreat! It is the judgment of God
upon us for undertaking to make war upon the beasts. Let them keep my
kidnapped daughter, in Heaven&rsquo;s name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immediately the army wheeled about to retreat, but even on that side
the earth gave way beneath their feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God is punishing us already,&rdquo; cried the Emperor in
despair, &ldquo;by causing the earth to swallow us up! Oh, why, then,
does He slay us with stones and rocks from the sky?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The confusion was universal; every one was pushing and crowding his
neighbor; and so the Emperor&rsquo;s whole army melted away.

<p>After a time the Fox removed his residence to Stamboul and began to
rule there, and the Beg gave up hunting and went also to Stamboul to be
near his Fox. There, with his wife, whom no one again dared to kidnap,
he lived in joy and peace until his blessed end.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The little boy had left his stool and was standing near his
grandmother, his eyes shining in the darkness. When she stopped
speaking he drew a long breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a good Fox, grandmother,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
should like to know that Fox.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was very interesting in the little boy&rsquo;s
house the next day, for the mother was getting ready for the journey
and the sisters were helping. There was food to be cooked and there
were clothes to be washed, and it all made a very pleasant bustle. The
little boy was in the thick of it all. He thought he was helping,
though perhaps the others thought differently. At any rate, he was in a
state of most delightful excitement.</p>
<p>When it grew dark the work was all done, and the little boy went to
the grandmother&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are all ready, grandmother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I
have been patient all the time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; said the grandmother. <span class=

<p>&ldquo;Not about Reinecke, nor any of the animals you know,&rdquo;

<h3 class="main">&ldquo;THE SEVEN STARS&rdquo;</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time there was a King who had a
wonderfully beautiful daughter. But there came a Dragon and stole her
away and vanished, leaving not a trace behind.</p>
<p>So the King called his High Chamberlain and commanded him to go
forth into the world and seek the Princess, and on no account to come
back without her.</p>
<p>The High Chamberlain set out and searched throughout the whole
world, but nowhere could he find the slightest trace of the
King&rsquo;s daughter nor the least clew to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name="pb130">130</a>]</span>her
whereabouts. However, an old woman advised him to go to such-and-such a
country and inquire for the Dragon-mother, for she alone was able to
give him information about the stolen Princess.</p>
<p>And, verily, the High Chamberlain followed this counsel. After most
toilsome wanderings he at last arrived safely at the
Dragon-mother&rsquo;s house and begged her to give him such information
as she had as to the abiding-place of the King&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<p>The Dragon-mother answered, &ldquo;My dear friend, stay here over
this night. What God has given us we will share with you&mdash;you
shall not suffer hunger in my house. As soon as my sons, the Dragons,
return home from afar I will ask them about the Princess. I have five
sons, each one wiser and cleverer than the other. The first has the
power of stealing anything that he takes a fancy to; he could steal the
calf from the cow or the foal from the mare, and they <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name=
"pb131">131</a>]</span>never observe it. The second can follow up the
trace of any lost object, though it have been lost for years. The third
draws a sure arrow upon anything that he can see. The fourth can build
an impregnable fortress in an instant, and can hide anything he chooses
within it, so that no one can possibly find it. And the fifth is as
bold as a falcon and as swift as the lightning when there is anything
to be overtaken and caught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While she was speaking, her sons, the Dragons, came home, and the
mother inquired of them if they knew anything of the whereabouts of the
King&rsquo;s lost daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; they answered. &ldquo;She is with a more
powerful Dragon than we. He stole her away from her father, the King,
and now keeps her in one of his castles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I adjure you,&rdquo; interrupted the High Chamberlain,
&ldquo;help me to find her. I may on no account appear before the King
and live unless I bring his daughter with me. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name="pb132">132</a>]</span>My
master will not show himself ungrateful to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Dragons declared themselves quite willing to help him. The
second brother traced up the scent, and the first brother stole the
lovely maiden and brought her back with him. But the more powerful
Dragon pursued after them, took her away, and flew up into the air to
carry her to a place of safety.</p>
<p>Then the third brother fitted a bolt to his crossbow, drew it, sped
the arrow, and hit that Dragon in the very middle of his heart. With a
fearful outcry the Dragon fell from the clouds and was dashed to little
bits upon a rock. And thus it would inevitably have been with the
King&rsquo;s daughter, whom the Dragon held tightly clasped, had not
the fifth brother flown swiftly and caught up the maiden, so that she
was kept safe and sound.</p>
<p>But now ensued a sudden and unlooked-for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name=
"pb133">133</a>]</span>danger, for the dead Dragon&rsquo;s brother drew
near, and several other monsters with him; and it would soon have been
all over with the brothers if the fourth had not speedily erected a
strong fortress, in which all the brothers, the King&rsquo;s daughter,
and the High Chamberlain safely concealed themselves.</p>
<p>For a long time those hideous Dragons lay in wait around the
fortress; but they finally went away, having accomplished nothing. Then
the five brothers, the gracious maiden, and the High Chamberlain came
out and went home to the Dragon-mother.</p>
<p>And the eldest son said, &ldquo;Is it not true, little mother, that
the maiden belongs to me, who rescued her from that furious
Dragon?&rdquo; The second brother said, &ldquo;But you would never have
found her nor rescued her if I had not traced up the scent.&rdquo; The
third brother interrupted, &ldquo;Of what good <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name=
"pb134">134</a>]</span>would it have been that you, eldest brother,
rescued her, and you, second brother, traced up the scent, if I had not
destroyed the monster at the right moment? Therefore, in all right and
reason, the maiden belongs to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the fifth brother struck in. &ldquo;By right the maiden belongs
to me; for if I had not caught her up in the very nick of time she
would not now be in the land of the living.&rdquo; And the fourth
brother said, &ldquo;If you will consider the whole matter impartially,
you will see that I have the most righteous claim upon the maiden; for
all your trouble would have gone for nothing if I had not made the
castle at the right moment and hidden her, and you, too, to come within
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now the Chamberlain put in his word. &ldquo;All your pretensions
are idle. The maiden is mine; for if I had not told you that she was
stolen away, the first would not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135"
href="#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span>have rescued her, nor the
second traced up the scent, nor the third destroyed the monster, nor
the fifth caught up the maiden, and the fourth would have concealed no
one in his castle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus all the six strove for possession of the maiden, until the
Dragon-mother put in her word. &ldquo;If this is so, then you are all
in the right; but the maiden can surely not belong to you all. But you
can all take her for your sister and love and protect her as long as
you and she live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so they did, and in remembrance thereof they and the maiden were
set in the sky, and can be seen there to this day, and men call them
&ldquo;the Seven Stars.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2726src"

<p>&ldquo;Dragons are different from Reinecke and Petz and

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like them as well?&rdquo; asked the

<p>&ldquo;I like them,&rdquo; answered the little boy, &ldquo;but I
don&rsquo;t know them as well as I know Reinecke and Isegrim. I am not
used to them, grandmother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will get used to them while you are at your other
grandmother&rsquo;s, where you are going to-morrow,&rdquo; said the
grandmother. &ldquo;The stories of her commune are not at all the same
as the stories of this commune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not, grandmother?&rdquo; asked the little boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why not,&rdquo; answered the grandmother,
&ldquo;but it is always so. Every commune has its own stories. There
are many dragons in those of your other grandmother&rsquo;s commune.
Now you are going out into the world, you will get very wise, for you
will know the stories of two communes.&rdquo; <span class=

<h2 class="main">MOTHER&rsquo;S-MOTHER</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The happy day had come. The little boy was all ready
for the journey, dressed in a colored shirt hanging over his full
trousers&mdash;the white shirt must be kept clean for Sunday, you
know&mdash;his <i>kaftan</i> well belted down and with a small fur
collar at the neck, and on his head a high <i>kolpak</i>, or fur hat,
just like his father&rsquo;s. His legs were covered by <i>onontchi</i>,
well wrapped around and cross-gartered with colored strings, and on his
feet he had fur-lined shoes, for third-class cars are very cold. The
little boy&rsquo;s mother had on all her warm clothes, with a long fur
overcoat, just like that the father wore, over all her other wraps; and
the father, besides his great fur <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138"
href="#pb138" name="pb138">138</a>]</span>overcoat, had on his fur
<i>kolpak</i> and high fur-lined boots, into the wide tops of which his
full trousers were tucked. He had a great basket in his hand,
containing food for the journey and a pair of fowls and some other
things for the mother&rsquo;s-mother whom they were going to visit. In
his inside pocket the father had the papers of the <i>mir</i> which he
must carry to the <i>zemstvo</i>. So they were all ready.</p>
<p>All the men and children of the village accompanied them to the
station, which was in the midst of a wide plain a quarter of a league
beyond the last house. There was a good while to wait; the train was
not due for half an hour, but that did not matter. The grown folk had a
deal of talking to do&mdash;all the privileges that they hoped the
<i>starosta</i> would secure from the <i>zemstvo</i> for the commune.
As for the children! Well, this was the chance of their lives, for
their station had a playground, with swings, wooden horses,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name=
"pb139">139</a>]</span>and giant&rsquo;s strides, and it was not often
they had such privileges, especially the uniformed school-children. For
when once a Russian child puts on the school uniform, play is pretty
nearly over for him for the rest of his life. So they made the most of
their opportunity. It was not a cold day for January, and if it had
been they would not have minded.</p>
<p>When the train came lumbering in, as it did after a while, half a
dozen more children jumped down from the second and third class cars
and ran to the playground. The other children made way for them, for
station playgrounds are for travelling children, and they had the first
right. Yet there was room for them all. But the little boy was
impatient to be on his travels, so he ran to his mother, and was very
glad when the men of the commune had said their last words to their
representative, and the <i>starosta</i> led his wife and little boy to
a good place in a compartment <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140"
href="#pb140" name="pb140">140</a>]</span>where there was room for the
<i>samovar</i>. Presently the first warning was given. The children
came running from the playground; there was a chorus of good-bys. The
second warning sounded, and the train jolted away. The little boy was a
travelling child at last!</p>
<p>At every stop where there was a playground&mdash;there was not one
at every station&mdash;he would run out and have a swing, his mother
going with him, for he was a little boy to be among strangers. After a
while he was hungry, and then his mother unpacked her basket and set
the <i>samovar</i> a-going, and gave a lump of bread and a big piece of
sausage to each, with unlimited cups of scalding tea that made them
nice and warm. After that the little boy leaned his head against his
mother, and then&mdash;most wonderful!&mdash;they were already at the
capital, and the stars were shining. Where had the afternoon gone?
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span></p>
<p>He had not time to ask, for his father had swung him upon his
shoulder and was carrying him through the crowd, and there, outside the
wicket, was a little old woman, with such a nice face, who fell upon
his mother&rsquo;s neck and kissed her again and again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is your other grandmother,&rdquo; said his father.
&ldquo;Your mother has not seen her since she was married, and that is
many years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then the other grandmother caught the little boy from his
father&rsquo;s arms and kissed him and cried over him, till the little
boy did not know whether he ought to cry or not.</p>
<p>He became very well acquainted with the other grandmother the next
day. She did not seem like his own dear little grandmother at home, but
she was very nice. He called her mother&rsquo;s-mother, because she was
not his real grandmother, he thought; and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb142" href="#pb142" name="pb142">142</a>]</span>the other grandmother
laughed and said that would do very well.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, when his father had gone back to the
<i>zemstvo</i>, and his mother was clearing up after dinner, which she
said her mother was not to do while she was there, the little boy went
and stood by his other grandmother&rsquo;s chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s-mother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;little
grandmamma told me that you knew some nice stories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said mother&rsquo;s-mother, &ldquo;I suppose I
do. They are not like your little grandmamma&rsquo;s stories. The
stories of this commune are different. They are more about the Vilas
than those of your commune are. Yours are mostly about Reinecke and the
other beasts, are they not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like Reinecke and the beasts,&rdquo; said the little boy.
&ldquo;But I should like the Vilas, too,
mother&rsquo;s-mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will tell you about them,&rdquo; said <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name="pb143">143</a>]</span>the
other grandmother. &ldquo;Sit down on that stool&mdash;it was your
mother&rsquo;s when she was a little girl. That is right. Now I will
tell you about</p>

<h3 class="main">&ldquo;THE VILA OF MUHLENBERG&rdquo;</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time there was an aged widow who had only
one son, whom she watched and cherished in her old age. Now there was a
great war at that time all over the world; every man who could bear
arms was forced to go into the army, and among others the widow&rsquo;s
son. There he so distinguished himself for bravery on every occasion
that he was promoted to be Captain.</p>
<p>Now it happened one time that they suffered a defeat. Among the
wounded was our Captain, and as he lay on the ground he prayed God to
spare his life, at least until he had seen his old mother. He was in
the greatest danger, for all around him the enemy was killing the
wounded. Suddenly an <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144"
name="pb144">144</a>]</span>aged dame stood before him and asked him
what he was praying for, promising him that she would grant his
wish.</p>
<p>Without taking time to think, he answered, &ldquo;Give me a horse,
that I may escape before the enemy murder me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon this she struck upon the earth with the staff that was in her
hand, and softly murmured a few words. Suddenly a noble steed stood
before him, all saddled and bridled; he had only to mount it. He looked
around to thank the old dame, but she had vanished.</p>
<p>The Captain sprang into the saddle, gave the horse the spur, and
flew from the spot like an arrow from the bow. He rode on for a long
time without noticing in what direction the horse was carrying him,
when suddenly it stopped.</p>
<p>He looked around and saw before him a great city with many
church-towers which shone so brightly that they fairly dazzled his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name=
"pb145">145</a>]</span>eyes. He rode into the city, and was overcome
with astonishment, for all around him was nothing but stone. Men,
women, animals, everything he set his eyes upon was turned to stone,
for this was an enchanted city. And the horse was a Vila, and had
vanished from under him as soon as he had entered the precincts of the
city.</p>
<p>Perhaps he himself would have remained the whole day upon the spot,
as if turned to stone, had he not suddenly beheld before him a maiden
with golden hair. When she saw him she uttered a cry and hastened up
into the golden castle.</p>
<p>He followed close upon her footsteps, but before the castle-gate he
met the same old woman who had given him the horse. He greeted her
prettily and asked her what was all this about&mdash;the golden-haired
maiden and the enchanted city. Hereupon the old dame told him the
following story:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many, many years ago this city was the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name=
"pb146">146</a>]</span>greatest and the most beautiful in the whole
world. An Emperor lived here, who was so benevolent and such a lover of
justice that whenever he heard that any one had done his neighbor a
kindness he rewarded him so richly and with such distinction that he
could live to his dying day in peace and happiness. On the other hand,
he was unmercifully severe to evil-doers and caused every one who was
guilty of any sort of crime to be put to death at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For this reason some wicked men killed him and his only son.
But as they were murdering the son they heard an awful voice, which
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Miserable wretches! you have killed him who was your
benefactor and father. Be accursed, therefore, for a thousand years,
until a youth shall come and loose you from this ban!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the Emperor&rsquo;s daughter, whom the Lord God had given
to me, remained alive, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href=
"#pb147" name="pb147">147</a>]</span>for God said, &lsquo;She shall be
the reward of him who frees you.&rsquo; Meantime, however, she was
turned to stone until the moment when you entered the city. Then she
awoke, cried, &lsquo;The Liberator is come!&rsquo; and brought the news
to me. You yourself have seen her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So spoke the old dame, and, full of joy, the young man asked her
what he was to do in order to loose the city from the spell. She
answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can give you no counsel, but you will soon find that out
above. And now, as you have no more need of me, farewell, in
God&rsquo;s name! But first I will tell you who I am. I am a Vila. If
ever you should fall into any trouble, you have only to call,
&lsquo;Vila, stand by me!&rsquo; and you shall be helped.&rdquo; She
spoke, and was already gone.</p>
<p>The young man and the maiden were now in doubt as to what they ought
to do. They would gladly have wedded each other, but <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name=
"pb148">148</a>]</span>where find a priest, or even any one else? So
they went into a church to pray to God; and the maid said to the youth,
&ldquo;From this hour you are my husband and I am your wife till death.
But go at least and set the bells a-ringing, that our nuptials may be
celebrated in some way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hardly had the first note pealed forth from the bells when
everything breathed and lived&mdash;the men, the beasts, everything, in
short, which had been turned to stone. Then all the people broke out
into the cry, &ldquo;God save our Liberator, now and
evermore!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first thing was to celebrate a magnificent wedding, when the
<i>pop</i> united the pair forever in the presence of the whole
assembled people. Every one rejoiced, eating and drinking as if they
never meant to leave off.</p>
<p>The young couple lived for several years in joy and happiness, until
at last the King <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149"
name="pb149">149</a>]</span>was overcome with an ardent longing to see
his dear mother. He confided this wish to his wife, whereupon she led
him into the royal stables and presented him with four horses,
saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, I give you these four horses. You must know that they
are Vilas, and they will take you to your home, for you have no idea
how far away it is. But if any one there asks you where you have been
and what you have been doing all this time, beware of telling them the
truth, for if you relate your adventures the Vilas will vanish, and you
will never be able to come back to me again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He promised her everything that she asked and set out for home. When
he arrived he found his dear mother no longer living. His heart was
wrung with sorrow, for there he stood alone in the world, brotherless,
sisterless, without a single relative.</p>
<p>The people questioned him incessantly, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb150" href="#pb150" name="pb150">150</a>]</span>until at last in a
moment of weakness he yielded to their importunities and told them his
story. But the words had hardly passed his lips when the horses
vanished. He was inconsolable for their loss, for he loved his wife
more than his own soul.</p>
<p>He therefore determined to seek her out, even if it cost him his
head. So he travelled on and on and on until he came to the Moon. There
was no one at home but the Moon-mother, for the Moon had just gone out.
When the Moon-mother saw the young man she was full of pity for him,
and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you not know, unhappy one, that my son will tear you in
pieces as soon as he gets home? But come, I will hide you!&rdquo; And
she hid him in a chest.</p>
<p>When at last the Moon came home, tired and cross, he called out in a
thundering voice, &ldquo;Woman, there is a Christian soul staying here!
Out with him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His mother besought her son to spare the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span>young man&rsquo;s life, and finally she
succeeded in mollifying him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I won&rsquo;t do him any harm,&rdquo; said the
Moon; &ldquo;only let him show himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon this the old mother opened the chest and brought the young man
before her son. The youth drew near to the Moon, bowed low before him,
and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mighty Moon! you shed your mild rays over the whole earth;
tell me if you know anything of a city called Muhlenberg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Moon replied, &ldquo;I indeed shine over the whole round earth,
but I have never heard of any Muhlenberg. Therefore, I counsel you,
seek out my brother the Sun; perhaps he can tell you something about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man thanked the Moon, and went to the Moon&rsquo;s
brother, the Sun, and said, &ldquo;Your brother the Moon sends
greeting, and says, in case you know anything about the city
Muhlenberg, you are to tell me.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb152" href="#pb152" name="pb152">152</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Sun replied that he knew nothing of any such city, and sent him
to the North-wind, saying, &ldquo;This wind blows everywhere and
searches out the most hidden corners; perhaps he knows the
city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the North-wind sent him to the East-wind, and the East-wind sent
him to the West-wind, and the West-wind sent him to the South-wind, the
most fearful of all the winds.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2915src"
href="#xd21e2915" name="xd21e2915src">1</a></p>
<p>When the young man appeared before the South-wind, he bowed low and
said, &ldquo;I bring you greetings from all your relatives, the Sun,
the Moon, the North-wind, the East-wind, and the West-wind, and you are
to give me some information about the city Muhlenberg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said the South-wind, &ldquo;I have just come from Muhlenberg. There
will soon be grand doings in that city, for the Queen is going to be
married.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153"
name="pb153">153</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then the young man implored the South-wind to take him there. The
South-wind answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is pretty far from here, and you don&rsquo;t know the way;
but take this apple, and wherever it rolls do you follow it, and you
will come to Muhlenberg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man bade the South-wind adieu and followed the apple,
going on for a long, long time. Suddenly he came upon some robbers. He
went up to them as if they were old acquaintances, exclaiming,
&ldquo;Good-day to you, brothers! Are you right well? Here I am with
you at last!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They really believed that he was one of themselves, so they took him
with them, and showed him a coat which had the power of rendering
invisible the person who wore it. Next they showed him a pair of boots
that would enable one to put a mile behind him at every step. He put on
both the coat and the boots, as if to test the truth of the story,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name=
"pb154">154</a>]</span>and immediately made off. The robbers could not
even think of trying to follow him, since they could not see him.</p>
<p>So he rolled the apple again along the ground before him, and at
last he arrived at Muhlenberg. He heard music in every part of the
city, cannons were thundering, and above all swept the South-wind.</p>
<p>When the South-wind saw him he went down and greeted him, saying,
&ldquo;So here we are, at last, in Muhlenberg!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man now went into the city, and, being still invisible, he
helped himself to all the food and drink he wanted, and refreshed
himself with his gossip, the South-wind. Then, taking leave of him, he
made his way into the royal palace which had once been his own. There
he saw the Queen beside the newly chosen spouse whom she was about to
marry, and heard her sigh:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just seven years ago to-day my beloved husband deserted
me!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name=
"pb155">155</a>]</span></p>
<p>Upon this he began to sing a song which he used to be always singing
when he was king. She recognized it at once, and, full of joy, cried
out, &ldquo;That is my husband, my first good fortune! My
wedding-guests, drink the foaming wine and take your leave. I have no
need to marry, for my husband has come home again, my only joy and
bliss!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And from this time they lived long and happily together. And the
Queen bore to her husband a son with a mole like a golden sword upon
his arm, and a beautiful golden-haired daughter.</p>
<p>So ends the story.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;I should like to go to the Moon,&rdquo; observed the little
boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t go nowadays,&rdquo; said the other
grandmother. &ldquo;That was long ago, before my great-grandmother was
born.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name=

<p class="first">The little boy did not know what to do with himself,
for they were very busy getting dinner ready against his father&rsquo;s
return from the <i>zemstvo</i>. He did not know how to play in this
house as he did in his own; he felt a little homesick, and presently he
began to cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; asked his mother, who was making
the onion-soup.</p>
<p>The little boy only cried the more. &ldquo;I want my little
grandmamma!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She would tell me a
story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you a story,&rdquo; said the other

<h3 class="main">THE GOLDEN APPLE-TREE AND THE NINE PEAHENS</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time there was an Emperor who had three
sons. Before his palace stood a golden apple-tree which bloomed and
bore ripe fruit in one and the self-same night; but it was always
plundered by some one who left not the slightest trace behind.</p>
<p>At last the father said to his sons, &ldquo;Who can have made away
with the fruit of our apple-tree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon this the eldest son said, &ldquo;I will watch the tree
to-night, and will teach the rogue to know better!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So when twilight began to fall he went and laid himself down beneath
the apple-tree to guard it. But he fell asleep just as the apples began
to ripen, and when at dawn he awoke, the tree had been already
stripped. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name=
"pb159">159</a>]</span>He therefore went to his father and truthfully
told him the whole story.</p>
<p>Then the second son pledged himself to guard the tree; but it
happened with him precisely as with the other. He fell asleep under the
apple-tree, and when the dawning light awoke him not an apple remained
upon the tree.</p>
<p>It was now the turn of the youngest son to watch the tree. He made
himself ready, went out to the tree, prepared his bed immediately under
it, and laid himself down to sleep. Just at midnight he suddenly awoke.
He cast a glance upward into the tree, the fruit of which was just
beginning to ripen. The whole castle glittered with its golden
sheen.</p>
<p>At that very moment nine golden Peahens came flying by; eight of
them settled upon the apple-tree, but the ninth flew down upon the
young man&rsquo;s bed and transformed herself into a beautiful
maiden&mdash;a more <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160"
name="pb160">160</a>]</span>beautiful was not to be found in the whole
empire.</p>
<p>So the two kissed and caressed each other until after midnight, when
the maiden stood up, thanked him for the apples, and would have gone,
but he entreated her earnestly to leave him at least one. She gave him
two&mdash;one he was to keep for himself, the other he might give to
his father. Then she transformed herself into a Peahen and flew away
with the others.</p>
<p>At daybreak the imperial Prince arose and carried the apples to his
father, who was overjoyed at the sight, and heaped praises upon his
son.</p>
<p>When evening came again the imperial Prince made ready his
resting-place, as on the former evening, in order to watch the
apple-tree. Having had the same experiences as on the preceding night,
he again brought two golden apples to his father.</p>
<p>When this had gone on for several nights <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name="pb161">161</a>]</span>the
brothers became envious, because they had not succeeded in guarding the
apples. So they went to an old hag, who promised to spy upon the Prince
and discover how he managed to guard the apple-tree so successfully.
When evening came on, the old woman stole out to the tree, crept under
the bed, and there hid herself.</p>
<p>Presently the youngest imperial Prince came out and betook himself,
as usual, to rest. About midnight the nine Peahens came, and eight
settled down upon the tree while the ninth flew down to the bed and
transformed herself into a maiden. The old hag slyly seized the long
braid of the maiden&rsquo;s hair, which hung down below the edge of the
bed, and cut it off. But the maiden sprang up quickly, transformed
herself again into a Peahen and flew away, with all her companions
following her, and so vanished.</p>
<p>The imperial Prince sprang up and cried <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name="pb162">162</a>]</span>out,
&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; He searched around and perceived the old
hag under the bed, seized her, dragged her out, and the next day
commanded that she should be put to death.</p>
<p>But the Peahens never returned to the apple-tree, and the imperial
Prince mourned and bewailed himself without ceasing. At last he
resolved to search for his little Peahen throughout the whole world,
and never return home until he had found her. He told his resolution to
his father, who tried to turn him from it, advising him to put the idea
out of his head, and promising to find him another maiden, though he
should have to search through his whole empire. But he spoke to deaf
ears; the prince was firm, and set out with his servant to seek for his
Peahen.</p>
<p>For a long time he wandered up and down the world, and one day he
came to a lake, beside which he saw a magnificent <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=
"pb163">163</a>]</span>great castle. In the castle he found an ancient
dame, the Empress, and a little girl, her daughter. He asked the dame,
&ldquo;In Heaven&rsquo;s name, little mother, can you give me any news
about nine golden Peahens?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the dame answered, &ldquo;To be sure I can, my son! They come
every midnight to bathe in this lake. But leave those Peahens in peace.
You shall have my little daughter, a splendid girl, and all my
treasures shall be yours as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he had no ear for the old dame&rsquo;s offer and no eye for the
daughter, being filled with longing to see the Peahens. He arose early
in the morning and went out to watch for the Peahens on the border of
the lake.</p>
<p>But the old dame had bribed the Prince&rsquo;s servant and given him
a pair of bellows such as one blows the fire with, adding these
directions:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see these bellows? When your <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name=
"pb164">164</a>]</span>master goes down to the lake, blow slyly upon
his neck with them. He will then fall into a deep sleep and will not be
able to speak with the Peahens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And to this the wretch of a servant consented.</p>
<p>When they were upon the lake-shore he seized a favorable opportunity
and blew upon his master&rsquo;s neck with the bellows, whereupon the
poor Prince fell into a deathlike slumber. He had barely fallen asleep
when the nine Peahens arrived; eight alighted in the lake, but the
ninth flew to the Prince upon his steed, and began to embrace and try
to waken him. &ldquo;Awake, my life! Awake, my heart! Awake, my
soul!&rdquo; But he moved no more than the dead.</p>
<p>When the Peahens had bathed they all flew away, and he immediately
awoke and asked the servant, &ldquo;What is the matter? Have they been
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The servant answered that nine Peahens <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb165" href="#pb165" name="pb165">165</a>]</span>had flown down to the
lake; eight had gone into the water, but the ninth had come to him, the
Prince, upon his horse, had caressed and tried to awaken him. At these
words the poor imperial Prince had nearly laid violent hands upon
himself.</p>
<p>The next day he again mounted his steed and rode slowly along the
lake-shore, his servant behind him. The servant again found an
opportunity to blow upon his neck with the bellows, whereupon the
Prince fell into a deathlike slumber. Scarcely was he asleep when the
nine Peahens arrived; eight went down into the lake, but the ninth flew
to him upon his steed, and began to embrace him and try to awaken him,
saying, &ldquo;Awake, my life! Awake, my heart! Awake, my
soul!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But all in vain; he slept sounder than the dead.</p>
<p>Then she said to the servant, &ldquo;Tell your master to wait for me
here again to-morrow, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href=
"#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span>for he will never see us here
again after that,&rdquo; and she again flew away.</p>
<p>She was scarcely gone when the imperial Prince awoke and asked the
servant, &ldquo;Have they been here?&rdquo; The servant replied,
&ldquo;To be sure, and they left word for you to expect them here again
to-morrow; but after that they will never again come to this
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the unhappy Prince heard this he was beside himself, and tore
his hair for grief and pain.</p>
<p>At dawn of the third day he again went down to the lake and rode
along the shore, but at the fleetest pace possible, in order not to be
overtaken by sleep. But even this time the servant found an opportunity
to blow upon his neck with the bellows, whereupon the Prince
immediately stretched himself out upon the horse&rsquo;s back and fell
asleep.</p>
<p>He was hardly asleep when the nine Peahens <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name="pb167">167</a>]</span>came
flying to the spot. Eight of them went down into the lake, but the
ninth flew to him upon the horse and began to embrace him and to call,
&ldquo;Awake, my life! Awake, my heart! Awake, my soul!&rdquo; But all
in vain, for he slept like the dead.</p>
<p>Then the Peahen said to the servant, &ldquo;When your master awakes,
say to him, <i>he must drive the upper wedge after the lower</i> before
he will be able to find me.&rdquo; With these words the Peahens flew
away.</p>
<p>When they were gone the imperial Prince awoke and said to the
servant, &ldquo;Have they been here?&rdquo; The servant answered,
&ldquo;To be sure, and the one which seated herself upon your horse
gave me orders to tell you that <i>you must drive the upper wedge after
the lower</i>, and then you would find her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he heard this the Prince drew his sword and struck off the
servant&rsquo;s head. Then he went on alone through the world.</p>
<p>After long, long wanderings he reached <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb168" href="#pb168" name="pb168">168</a>]</span>a high mountain,
where he spent the night with a hermit. From him he asked tidings of
the nine Peahens. The hermit answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son, you are surely fortune&rsquo;s own child! God himself
has led you in the right way. It is hardly more than half a day&rsquo;s
journey from here to there. You have only to ride straight forward and
you will come to a great gate. Then turn to the right and you will come
straight to the city where their castle is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By morning dawn the Prince awoke, dressed himself, pressed his
warmest thanks upon the hermit, and set out in the direction indicated.
He went straight forward, reached the great gate, passed through it,
and about noon he perceived a dazzling city, at sight of which his
heart cried out for joy.</p>
<p>In the city he inquired for the castle of the golden Peahens. At the
castle-gate a guard stopped him, asked after his country <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name="pb169">169</a>]</span>and
station, and when he had given the required information the guard went
in to announce him to the Empress.</p>
<p>When she heard of his arrival she ran to meet him like one beside
herself&mdash;being, of course, in human form; and giving him her arm
she led him into the castle. Great joy reigned through all the place,
and after a few days the pair were married, and he remained thenceforth
beside his beloved wife.</p>
<p>After a time the Empress went on an excursion, leaving the Prince at
home in the castle. Before going she gave him the keys of the twelve
rooms on the ground floor, with the words, &ldquo;You may go into all
of them except the twelfth. Open that one on no account, for you stake
your head in that game.&rdquo; With this warning she went away.</p>
<p>The imperial Prince remained alone in the castle, and began to
wonder, &ldquo;What can be in that twelfth room?&rdquo; Upon this
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name=
"pb170">170</a>]</span>he opened one room after the other, and when he
came to the twelfth he hesitated awhile about opening it. But the
thought, &ldquo;What can be in there?&rdquo; gave him no rest.</p>
<p>He therefore resolved to open the room; and lo! in the middle of it
stood a great open cask encircled with iron hoops, and a voice from
within cried, &ldquo;In Heaven&rsquo;s name, brother, I adjure thee,
give me a glass of water! I am perishing with thirst!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The imperial Prince took a glass of water and poured it into the
cask, whereupon one hoop of the cask fell off. Then again the voice
cried out of the cask, &ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, brother, I am
perishing with thirst! Give me another glass of water!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The imperial Prince poured in another glass of water, and the second
hoop fell from the cask. A third time the voice cried from the cask,
&ldquo;In Heaven&rsquo;s name, brother, I am perishing with thirst!
Give me one more glass of water!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb171" href="#pb171" name="pb171">171</a>]</span></p>
<p>The imperial Prince poured in a third glass, whereupon the third
hoop dropped off, the cask fell asunder, and a Dragon flew out, and
meeting the Empress upon the way, he carried her off as a prize. Soon
her attendants came in with the news, and the unhappy imperial Prince
knew not what to do for grief.</p>
<p>He finally decided to set out once more in search of his wife, and
so he wandered a long time up and down the world until he came to a
sheet of water upon the border of which he saw a little Fish
floundering about in a puddle. When the Fish saw the Prince he begged
him earnestly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, be a brother to me and throw me back
into the water! Some day I may be of the greatest use to you. Only pull
off one of my scales, and if you need my help rub it a
little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The imperial Prince took up the Fish and pulled out one of its
scales. He threw the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172"
name="pb172">172</a>]</span>Fish into the water, but the scale he
wrapped up in his handkerchief.</p>
<p>After a time, while he was still wandering about in the wide world,
he came upon a Fox which was caught in a trap. When the Fox saw him he
cried, &ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, be a brother to me and set me
free from this trap! I shall soon have occasion to do you service; only
take one of my hairs, and when you need my service rub it a
little.&rdquo; So the imperial Prince took the hair and set the Fox at
liberty.</p>
<p>Later, as he was going over a high mountain, he found a Wolf in a
trap. The Wolf also said to him when he saw him, &ldquo;For
Heaven&rsquo;s sake, be a brother to me and set me free. I will be your
helper in time of need; only take out one of my hairs, and if you need
my aid rub it a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the imperial Prince took the hair and set the Wolf free, and then
went on his journey.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name=
"pb173">173</a>]</span></p>
<p>After a long time he met a man, to whom he said, &ldquo;In the name
of Heaven, brother, have you ever heard where the
Dragon-emperor&rsquo;s castle is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man cheerfully told him, even to the very moment when he would
best present himself there. The imperial Prince expressed his thanks,
went straight on, and at last, nearly dead with fatigue, he arrived at
the Dragon&rsquo;s castle. He found his beloved one there, and both
were overjoyed at the meeting.</p>
<p>Then they took counsel as to the best way to attempt a flight. They
finally came to a decision, and, making ready with all despatch, they
mounted their horses to flee. But they had hardly left the castle when
the Dragon came riding home. He entered the castle, but the Empress was
gone!</p>
<p>So he said to his horse, &ldquo;What shall we do now? Shall we eat
and drink comfortably, or shall we hasten after the fugitives?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name=
"pb174">174</a>]</span></p>
<p>The horse replied, &ldquo;Eat and drink; we shall soon overtake
them. That is the least of your troubles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After dinner, therefore, the Dragon mounted his horse, and in a
trice had overtaken the fugitives. When he came up to them he snatched
the Empress from the Prince, with the words, &ldquo;Go, in God&rsquo;s
name! I forgive you this time, because you gave me water; but never
come back again, as you value your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The unhappy Prince went on a little farther, but the longing of his
heart was too strong, and he turned about. The next day he reappeared
in the Dragon&rsquo;s castle. He found the Empress alone and drowned in
tears. They again took counsel how they might escape, and the imperial
Prince thus spoke his mind:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the Dragon comes home, ask him where he obtained that
horse. Then do you tell me, that I may try to get one of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name=
"pb175">175</a>]</span>same kind, to outrun him if possible.&rdquo;
With these words he went away.</p>
<p>When the Dragon came home the Empress coaxed and cajoled him,
talking of all sorts of things, until at last she said, &ldquo;Well,
upon my word, you have a fleet horse! Tell me, in Heaven&rsquo;s name,
where did you get him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He replied, &ldquo;Where I got him it would not be easy to get
another. In such-and-such a high mountain lives an old woman who has
twelve horses, each one finer than the other, all standing before their
mangers. But in the corner stands a wretched, mangy horse; at least he
looks so at a first glance, but in fact he is the best one of all. He
is the brother of my horse. Heaven itself would not be too far off for
the owner of that steed. But whoever would get him from that old hag
must serve her for three days. She has a mare and a foal, and she will
require that they be watched for three <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb176" href="#pb176" name="pb176">176</a>]</span>nights. Whoever
succeeds in doing so may choose among her horses. But if any one enters
her service and fails to keep watch of the mare and colt, off goes his
head!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day when the Dragon was from home the imperial Prince came
to learn what the Empress had discovered. Then he went to that high
mountain where the old woman was, and greeted her with, &ldquo;God
bless you, little mother!&rdquo; and she answered with the pious
greeting, &ldquo;God help you, my little son! What good luck brings you
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He: &ldquo;I have a mind to enter your service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She: &ldquo;Very well, my little son. If you will keep watch of the
mare and foal for three whole days, then you may take your choice among
my horses; but if you fail, off goes your head!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon this she led him into the courtyard. It was surrounded by a
close paling, and on every pale was stuck a human head. Only
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name=
"pb177">177</a>]</span>one was unoccupied, and this one cried
incessantly, &ldquo;Old woman, put a head here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman showed all this to the Prince, with the words,
&ldquo;You see, all these were in my service without being able to
guard the mare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The imperial Prince was not to be frightened by such an exhibition,
but remained to serve the old woman. When it grew dark he mounted the
mare and rode out into the field, the foal running along beside the
mother. He sat constantly upon her back, but toward midnight he fell
asleep, and when toward dawn he awoke he found himself astride a block
of wood, holding fast to the halter.</p>
<p>When he saw this he was filled with horror, and sprang up to search
for the mare. In the course of his search he came upon a piece of
water. It reminded him of the little Fish which he had rescued from the
puddle and thrown into the lake. He therefore <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name="pb178">178</a>]</span>took
the scale out of his handkerchief and rubbed it a little between his
fingers. The Fish immediately spoke from the water, saying to him,
&ldquo;What is your desire, brother soul?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He answered, &ldquo;That old hag&rsquo;s mare has given me the slip.
I know not where to find her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Fish returned, &ldquo;She is here with us; she has transformed
herself into a fish and the foal into a little fish. Just strike upon
the water with the halter and say, &lsquo;The old hag&rsquo;s mare
still lives!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he struck upon the water, saying, &ldquo;The old hag&rsquo;s mare
still lives!&rdquo; and the mare became what she had been before and
swam to the shore with her foal. He therefore put the halter upon her
neck again, mounted her, and returned to the house, the foal running
along by her side.</p>
<p>When they reached the house the old woman gave him food; but she led
the mare <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name=
"pb179">179</a>]</span>into the stable and beat her with the oven-fork,
saying, &ldquo;Go among the fishes, you wretch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mare answered, &ldquo;Indeed, I did go among the fishes, but
they are in league with him and they betrayed me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon this the old hag rejoined, &ldquo;Then go among the
foxes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before dark the Prince again mounted the mare and went out into the
field, the foal running alongside. He sat continually upon the mare,
but toward midnight he fell asleep upon her back, and when he awoke he
found himself astride a block of wood, holding fast to the halter.</p>
<p>When he saw this he was overcome with terror and sprang upon his
feet to seek the mare. Suddenly he remembered what the old woman had
said to the mare, and he drew the Fox&rsquo;s hair out of his kerchief,
rubbed it between his fingers the least bit, and behold! the Fox stood
before <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name=
"pb180">180</a>]</span>him, saying, &ldquo;What is the matter, brother
soul?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince answered, &ldquo;The old hag&rsquo;s mare has escaped me,
and I do not know where to find her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Fox: &ldquo;She is among us; she has changed herself into a fox
and the foal into a fox-cub. Just strike upon the ground with the
halter and say, &lsquo;The old hag&rsquo;s mare still
lives!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the Prince struck upon the earth with the halter, saying,
&ldquo;The old hag&rsquo;s mare still lives!&rdquo; and the mare again
returned to her former shape and stood before him with her colt, as if
she had just arisen from the earth. So he put the halter upon her,
mounted, and rode back to the house, the foal running quietly at her
side.</p>
<p>Arrived at home, the old woman placed food before him; but she led
the mare into the stable and fell upon her with the oven-fork, saying,
&ldquo;Go among the foxes, you wretch!&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name="pb181">181</a>]</span></p>
<p>The mare answered, &ldquo;Indeed, I did go among the foxes, but they
are in league with him and betrayed me.&rdquo; She answered,
&ldquo;Then go among the wolves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When evening came the imperial Prince mounted the mare and rode out
to the field, with the foal running alongside. He sat continually upon
her back, but about midnight he fell asleep, and when he awoke he
perceived that he was astride a block of wood, with the halter in his
hand. When he saw this he sprang to his feet and began to search for
the mare; but in a moment he remembered what the old woman had said,
and without delay he drew forth the Wolf&rsquo;s hair from his kerchief
and rubbed it between his fingers.</p>
<p>There was the Wolf upon the spot. &ldquo;What is the matter, brother
soul?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince answered, &ldquo;The old hag&rsquo;s mare has escaped,
and I do not know where she is.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb182" href="#pb182" name="pb182">182</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Wolf: &ldquo;She is here among us; she has changed herself into
a wolf and her foal into a wolf-cub. But strike upon the earth with the
halter and say, &lsquo;The old hag&rsquo;s mare still
lives!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he struck upon the earth with the halter, saying, &ldquo;The old
hag&rsquo;s mare still lives!&rdquo; and, as before, she suddenly
appeared, with the foal at her side. Then the imperial Prince put the
halter upon her, mounted, and rode home, the foal running quietly by
her side.</p>
<p>Arrived at home, the old woman gave him food; but she led the mare
into the stable and trounced her well with the oven-fork, crying to
her, &ldquo;Why did you not go among the wolves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mare answered, &ldquo;Indeed, I was among the wolves, but they
are in league with him and betrayed me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the old woman came out, and the imperial Prince said to her,
&ldquo;See here, old <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183"
name="pb183">183</a>]</span>woman, I have served you true and faithful;
give me the wages you promised to give me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman: &ldquo;What has been promised must be performed, my
son; take your choice among the twelve horses in my stable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he answered, &ldquo;Ah, how should I choose? Give me the one in
the corner&mdash;that mangy one there; these fine steeds don&rsquo;t
suit me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman tried to talk him out of it. &ldquo;What whim is this,
choosing that mangy beast when there are so many splendid horses
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he stood by his choice, and said, &ldquo;Give me the one I want;
that was the agreement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman saw no help for it, and gave him the mangy horse,
whereupon he took leave of her and went away, leading the horse by the
bridle. As soon as he found <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href=
"#pb184" name="pb184">184</a>]</span>himself in the forest he rubbed
and curried his horse until his coat shone like pure gold. Then he
mounted him and set out at full speed. The horse flew like the wind,
and in a twinkling had borne him to the Dragon&rsquo;s castle.</p>
<p>As soon as the imperial Prince had entered he said to the Empress,
&ldquo;Get ready for the journey as quickly as possible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a moment both were ready. They mounted the horse and set forth in
the name of God.</p>
<p>Somewhat later the Dragon came home and found the Empress gone. He
therefore asked his horse, &ldquo;What now? Shall we eat and drink at
our ease, or shall we pursue after them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the horse replied, &ldquo;Eat or not, drink or not, pursue or
not, you will never overtake them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Dragon heard this he sprang upon his horse and rushed after
them. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185" name=
"pb185">185</a>]</span></p>
<p>When the pair saw the Dragon coming on behind them they were
overcome with affright and spurred the horse to greater speed. Now the
horse was a Vila, and he said to them, &ldquo;Have no fear; you have no
need to hasten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now and again, as the Dragon gained upon them, the Dragon&rsquo;s
horse cried to the Prince&rsquo;s horse, &ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s
sake, brother, wait a little. I shall burst if I have to chase you any
longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the other answered, &ldquo;What a fool you are to carry that
demon upon your back! Rear up smartly and dash him upon the rocks, and
come with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Dragon&rsquo;s horse heard this he ducked his head with all
his might, and, throwing out his hind legs, he flung the Dragon upon
the rocks, where he was dashed to fragments. Then the Dragon&rsquo;s
horse joined the fugitives, the Empress mounted him, and so they went
safely home <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name=
"pb186">186</a>]</span>to their own empire, and reigned there until
their dying day.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;I like Vilas very much, mother&rsquo;s-mother,&rdquo; said
the little boy. &ldquo;Can you tell any more Vila stories?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father says we are going home to-morrow,&rdquo; said the
little boy&rsquo;s mother, who had long ago finished the housework and
was sitting there with her knitting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t night yet,&rdquo; said the little boy
eagerly. &ldquo;You could tell me another story before

<p>The little boy listened with a very sober face. Finally he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because that is the way to silence teasing children,&rdquo;
replied the other grandmother. &ldquo;They used to do just the way it
tells in the story in my great-grandmother&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again there was a pause. The knitting-needles clicked fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I a teasing child?&rdquo; asked the little boy at
last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you are not, bless your little heart!&rdquo; said the

<p>&ldquo;Run out and see if the sun is setting,&rdquo; said the other

<p>The little boy ran out in the greatest hurry. The other
grandmother&rsquo;s house was upstairs and it had no court&mdash;that
was why she kept neither cow nor fowl. So he had to run down the dark
stone stairway, and he was in such haste that he fell down the last two
steps. But he picked himself up and ran out. There at the far end of
the long street was the sun, still quite above the clouds that would
wrap him up in bed by and by. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190"

<h3 class="main">THE YOUTH AND THE VILA</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time there was a father who had three
sons. Two of them passed for clever, but the third and youngest was
stupid, as every one agreed. When people wanted anything done they only
called upon the two clever ones, while they would not let the stupid
one have anything to do with them.</p>
<p>In their father&rsquo;s garden was a silver pear-tree which every
night bore flowers and fruit; but the pears were regularly plucked and
carried away by the Vilas. &ldquo;What the mischief!&rdquo; said the
eldest and the second brother, &ldquo;how long is this thing going to
last?&rdquo; and they determined to mount guard over the tree. But to
their youngest brother <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href=
"#pb191" name="pb191">191</a>]</span>they said, &ldquo;You are too
stupid for this work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they carried feather-beds and pillows out under the tree, lay
down, and went to sleep. While they were sleeping the Vilas came,
plucked the pears, and went away. As soon as they were gone the
brothers awoke, went back to the house, and told what had happened.</p>
<p>Then the stupid brother declared that he would watch the tree. That
he might not be overcome with sleep he made himself a bed of thorns;
but in spite of all he fell asleep. Yet he awaked when the Vilas came,
and saw one of them standing at his side. He pulled out one of her
hairs, whereupon the Vila vanished.</p>
<p>When morning came he saw that the hair was of gold. Going home, he
told what had happened to him, and declared his intention to go through
the world to seek out that Vila. But the two clever brothers answered,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name=
"pb192">192</a>]</span>&ldquo;What would you be able to find? It is
better for us two clever ones to go and seek her. Something may come of
it then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the two set out upon their way. The eldest found a shovel and
took it with him, and it did him good service. For when they got to the
Moon they found the door locked. Then they dug under the door and went
in. They found only the Moon-mother at home, and of her they inquired
if such-and-such a Vila lived there.</p>
<p>The Moon-mother answered, &ldquo;She lives in the Sun. How will you
get there? But see, here is a spider; she shall spin you a chain that
will reach from here to there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The spider went to work, spun a chain, and fastened it to the lock
of the Sun-door. So the brothers set out upon this bridge; but while
they were on the way the Sun came home, opened the door, and snapped
the chain in two. So the brothers fell off, and very luckily they
tumbled into their god-father&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb193" href="#pb193" name="pb193">193</a>]</span>cabbage-garden. So
they felt no harm, but went home and told their adventures.</p>
<p>Then the stupid brother set out. He found an ancient crone and
begged her to show him the way to the Moon. The old crone told him it
was not very hard to go there, and gave him a bucketful of down. So he
seated himself in the bucket and flew up to the Moon.</p>
<p>He entered the house and asked if a certain Vila lived there who
looked so-and-so. The Moon-mother answered, No, she lived in the Sun.
So he flew up to the Sun, arrived there safely, and carefully hid his
bucket in the cellar in the coolest place he could find, that it might
not be melted by the heat.</p>
<p>Meantime the Sun came home and asked, &ldquo;What is your
wish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I seek such-and-such a Vila.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sun brought her out and gave her <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb194" href="#pb194" name="pb194">194</a>]</span>to him, and he seated
himself beside her in the bucket and set out.</p>
<p>When they were half-way home the Sun came out to see how the
travellers were getting on; and he shone on them so scorchingly that
all the down was melted, the bucket lost its balance, and the youth and
the Vila fell down to earth and were caught in a tree. They cannot go
down, for under the tree sits an old wizard sorting out a capful of
human hairs. But the Vila slipped softly down the tree and put the
wizard to sleep. Then the youth clambered down and took the Vila
home.</p>
<p>They reached his father&rsquo;s house, where he told all his
adventures; but the Vila was invisible to every one but her rescuer, so
that no one believed his story. Then the Vila began to weep, and the
brothers said, &ldquo;Good! now we believe that she is here, but just
where she is we do not know.&rdquo;</p>

and came into the room where they were. He greeted the Vila with
&ldquo;Good-day!&rdquo; whereupon she became visible to every one as a
beautiful maiden.</p>
<p>Soon after the youth married her. I was present at the wedding, ate
and drank with the old man and conversed much with him; and we
moistened our throats so often with sweet wine from Zagorje that my

<p class="first">The little boy could not sleep. The room was full of
people very excitedly talking about the action of the <i>zemstvo</i> on
some subject of importance, and although he did not understand a word
that they were saying, the talking and the thought of to-morrow&rsquo;s
journey kept him awake. He was lying on a pallet laid upon the bench
against the wall in a far corner of the room, and he turned over so
often that at last he fell upon the floor. He tried hard not to cry,
but he could not quite help it.</p>
<p>The other grandmother picked him up and cuddled him in her arms.
&ldquo;Go to sleep,&rdquo; she said, patting him gently. <span class=

<h3 class="main">THE VILA IN THE GOLDEN CASTLE</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time there was a father who had three
sons. One day he bade the eldest go into the garden and keep watch that
the swans did not eat the flowers. The son kept watch a long time, but
at last sleep overcame him, and immediately the swans came and ate up
the flowers.</p>
<p>Now these were not really swans, but Vilas.</p>
<p>Upon this the second brother betook himself to the garden, and with
the same result.</p>
<p>Then it was the youngest brother&rsquo;s turn; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name="pb198">198</a>]</span>but
this one put thorns under his head, so that he could not go to sleep.
He lay there in a doze until the swans arrived; then, springing nimbly
upon his feet, he caught one of them, which changed herself into a
Vila. Upon this the other swans flew away, and the Vila and the youth
both lay down and fell asleep.</p>
<p>Shortly after a girl came along that way and cut off the
Vila&rsquo;s hair. When the Vila awoke she fell into the deepest
dejection over the loss. The youth asked her, &ldquo;My beloved,
wherefore so sorrowful?&rdquo; and she answered, &ldquo;Some one has
robbed me of my hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She remained with him for a whole week. Then, as it chanced, he was
obliged to go away somewhere, and she improved the opportunity to quit
the house&mdash;not, however, without leaving word that he would find
her in the golden castle.</p>
<p>When he returned home and asked after <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb199" href="#pb199" name="pb199">199</a>]</span>her, he learned that
she had gone to the golden castle. He therefore set out to find it.
After much walking he came to a great forest, where he met an old man,
whom he asked if he could give him any information about the golden
castle.</p>
<p>The old man said he knew nothing about it, but perhaps a still older
man, who lived a long way off in the forest, might know where it was.
After long wandering the youth found this man, but neither could he
give him any information, but sent him to a still older man. So he
sought out the third old man, and from him he received the desired
information.</p>
<p>The young man set out in the direction indicated, arrived at the
castle, and perceived his beloved one, who smiled kindly upon him. In
the castle he found an old Vila, who told him that he should not have
her daughter to wife until he had executed the order which she was
about to give. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200" name=
"pb200">200</a>]</span>Then she handed him a wooden hoe, with the
words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you wish to be my son-in-law you must root up all this
forest, plant vines in its place, and bring me wine from their fruit;
and all must be done to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This command he certainly could not obey; but his beloved one drew
near and asked him, &ldquo;Why are you so sorrowful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He answered, &ldquo;Why should I not be sorrowful? I can surely
never obey that command.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she cut down a tree, and the whole forest was uprooted; she
planted a vine, and the whole vineyard was planted; she pressed one
grape, and the work was already done.</p>
<p>When he brought the wine into the castle the old Vila said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must perform another task. In a single day you must sow
wheat, reap and thresh it, and store it away in the granary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He would not have been equal to this task <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201" name=
"pb201">201</a>]</span>either had not his beloved one done it for
him.</p>
<p>When he showed the old Vila the threshed wheat she was still not
satisfied, but said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you wish to be my son-in-law you must gild the whole
castle.&rdquo; To this end she gave him a golden nut.</p>
<p>He succeeded in gilding a hand&rsquo;s breadth, but more he could
not do. Then his beloved came to his help; she only made a cross, and
in a twinkling the whole was done.</p>
<p>Still the old Vila said, &ldquo;If you are positively determined
upon being my son-in-law you must to-morrow guess which Vila is yours.
I may tell you beforehand that they all look precisely alike, even to a
hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then his beloved one told him to notice well. When all the Vilas
were standing in a row, a little dog would come and nose around her
alone, and he must say, &ldquo;That one is she.&rdquo; She also gave
him a comb, and a brush into the bargain, saying that they <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name=
"pb202">202</a>]</span>would be of the greatest use to them in their
flight.</p>
<p>The next day, when the Vilas stood in a row before him, the little
dog came and nosed around one of them. He at once said that this was
she, and immediately they took to flight, the old Vila after them.</p>
<p>She had almost overtaken the fugitives, but the youth threw the
brush behind them, and a thick forest grew up at their back, so that
they gained a considerable start. But the old Vila soon overcame this
hinderance, and had nearly caught up to them when, at the very moment,
he threw the comb behind him. Instantly a great river flowed between
them which the old woman could not cross.</p>
<p>Thus the two got away at last, arrived safely at home, married, and
lived in happiness till their dying day.</p>

<h2 class="main">HOME AGAIN</h2>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was already dark when they reached home, though it
was not late, for January days are very short. There had been no
children at the station, only men, and the walk home had seemed very
long to the little boy. The men were talking very loudly, sometimes
even angrily&mdash;they did not seem to be pleased with what the little
boy&rsquo;s father told them about the <i>zemstvo</i>. It had not done
what the people of the village wanted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, God and the <i>mir</i> for us all!&rdquo; said the
little boy&rsquo;s father as they reached the house.</p>
<p>All the family were gathered to meet them&mdash;the grandmother, the
oldest brother <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name=
"pb204">204</a>]</span>and his wife, and the brother and sisters who
lived at home. They were glad to see the little boy, but they all
seemed more interested in what the father had to say about the
<i>zemstvo</i>, and the little boy could not understand that at all.
Though his grandmother held him by the hand and occasionally patted him
on the head, she hardly spoke to him. Presently, however, she went to
her own room, taking the little boy with her, and then it was his turn!
His little tongue ran fast as he told her all about the journey and the
other grandmother and the stories she had told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never told me about the Vilas, little grandma,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I not tell you that the stories of her <i>mir</i> are not
the same as the stories of our <i>mir</i>?&rdquo; replied the
grandmother. &ldquo;I do not know those Vila stories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you know other stories, very nice stories, little
grandmamma,&rdquo; said the little <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205"
href="#pb205" name="pb205">205</a>]</span>boy. Then, after a pause,
&ldquo;Please tell me one now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the grandmother told the story of</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">PRINCE HEDGEHOG</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time there was an Emperor and an Empress
who for many years had been childless. One day the Empress wished for a
son, were he no bigger than a hedgehog. The proverb says, &ldquo;What
one wishes for, that one gets,&rdquo; and so it was with her, for she
shortly gave birth to a son who looked exactly like a hedgehog and was
covered all over with sharp spines.</p>
<p>Far and wide the news was spread abroad through the world, and the
parents were much ashamed of such a son. Nevertheless, they had him
educated in all useful knowledge, and he had so clever a head that by
the time he was fourteen he knew all knowledge through and through.</p>
<p>By this time his parents could no longer <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206" name=
"pb206">206</a>]</span>endure him near them, and they assigned to him a
great forest as a place of abode, feeling certain that he would then
fall a prey to a wolf or a fox or some sort of a beast. They strictly
commanded him not to return before the expiration of seven years. They
gave him permission, however, to take with him anything that he
especially cared for; but he would take nothing with him except a Sow
and a great Cock upon which he was wont to ride. With these he went
away into the forest.</p>
<p>Year out, year in, Prince Hedgehog remained in the forest, and he
raised so many swine that at last they were too many for even him to
count. Finally he thought to himself, &ldquo;My seven years are up; I
will go back home.&rdquo; So he quickly gathered his swine together and
drove them to the city of his parents.</p>
<p>When they perceived afar off the immense drove of swine, they
thought, &ldquo;Here <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207"
name="pb207">207</a>]</span>comes a wealthy swine-drover.&rdquo; But
soon they recognized their son, who was riding upon his Cock behind the
swine and making straight for the imperial castle. So they received him
into the castle and showed him the best of hospitality, dividing his
swine among different pens, for they filled every swine-pen in the
city.</p>
<p>While they were at table they asked their son how he enjoyed himself
in the forest, and said that if he wished to go back there they would
give him a goat this time. But he declared that he was not going back,
for he had made up his mind to marry.</p>
<p>The astonished parents replied, &ldquo;Why, what maiden would love
you and take you for a husband?&rdquo; The poor youth knew no answer to
this question, so he mounted his Cock and rode away.</p>
<p>Now the parents thought he would never come back again. But he was a
clever fellow, and he went as a suitor to the King of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208" name="pb208">208</a>]</span>of a
neighboring country who had three unmarried daughters.</p>
<p>When he found himself near the city the Cock flew up with him to the
window of the room in which the company were assembled enjoying
themselves. The Cock crowed with all his might, until the chamberlain
went to the window and asked what he wanted. The Hedgehog answered,
&ldquo;I come a-wooing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the King permitted him to come into the room, and offered him
the welcome-cup, according to ancient manner and custom. Then the King
again asked him what business brought him, and Hedgehog, the imperial
Prince, answered him shortly and to the point, &ldquo;I come
a-wooing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King immediately assured him that he had only to choose one of
the three unmarried daughters. The Hedgehog chose the youngest, but she
would not have him for a husband until her father threatened to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209" name=
"pb209">209</a>]</span>have her shot unless she gave a cheerful
consent.</p>
<p>She saw no help for it, and thought to herself, &ldquo;I can never
get out of this scrape; come what may, I&rsquo;ll take him. We have
gold and treasure in abundance, and we shall easily get along through
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Hedgehog had received her consent he went back to his
parents and told them what had happened to him. His parents would not
believe him, and sent the chamberlain to inquire if it was true that
the Emperor&rsquo;s son, the Hedgehog, was to marry the King&rsquo;s
daughter. When the chamberlain returned and told the Emperor that his
son had spoken the truth, the Emperor ordered his horses to be
harnessed, and went with his wife to visit the King, riding in their
carriage, while their son rode behind on his Cock.</p>
<p>When they arrived they found everything ready for the wedding. But,
according to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name=
"pb210">210</a>]</span>custom, the bridal party were obliged to go to
the church a few days before the marriage to pray and confess to the
<i>pop</i>. When the young lady came to confession she asked the
<i>pop</i> how she might manage to get rid of the Prince and not be
obliged to marry him.</p>
<p>The <i>pop</i> gave her a sound scolding, and said in conclusion,
&ldquo;Just keep quiet and all will end well. Mark what I say, and
remember it well. When you are come into the church and are taking your
place in the sacristy, do you follow close behind the others. When you
get to the high altar sprinkle your bridegroom thrice with holy-water,
and be careful to prick yourself each time with one of his spines. Then
three drops of blood will trickle out of your hand, and you must let
these also fall upon him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After confession the bridal pair went home to breakfast. The next
day&mdash;it was a Sunday&mdash;the bridal party went at half-past
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name=
"pb211">211</a>]</span>eleven into the church, and the bride did in
every respect as the <i>pop</i> had counselled.</p>
<p>And, behold, the Hedgehog was transformed into a beautiful youth
whose like was not to be found in all the world. Then the bridal party
sat down upon the benches and heard Mass, and the <i>pop</i> united
them and preached them a sermon how they should cleave to each other
all their lives long.</p>
<p>After that they went back to the house, and the wedding-feast lasted
until late in the night. The wine was very good. I sat at the head of
the last table, drank yellow wine out of a painted cup and ate half a
swine all by myself.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;Some stories end that way, don&rsquo;t they,
grandmother?&rdquo; asked the little boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the grandmother, &ldquo;some of them
do.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name=

<h2 class="main">THE BETROTHAL</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Easter Day had come, and everybody in the house was
giving and returning the Easter greeting. The little boy ran into his
grandmother&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christ is risen, little grandmamma!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is risen indeed,&rdquo; the grandmother answered.</p>
<p>The older brother and sisters came to salute their grandmother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christ is risen!&rdquo; each one said to her, and to each she
answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is risen indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they all went to the parents&rsquo; room for the morning
prayer. They did this every morning, for Russian peasants are
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213" name=
"pb213">213</a>]</span>very devout; but Easter was a special morning,
and they sang many hymns and said many prayers. When they had finished,
the married son and his wife came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christ is risen, father and mother!&rdquo; they said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is risen indeed,&rdquo; the parents answered.</p>
<p>After church, which seemed very long to the little boy, they all
came home to dinner. With them came a strange young man whom the little
boy did not know. When they sat down at table he sat at the head and
the little boy&rsquo;s elder sister beside him. She had beautiful
flowers in her hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why does sister wear flowers in her hair?&rdquo; the little
boy asked his grandmother softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because she is a bride,&rdquo; whispered the grandmother.
&ldquo;She is betrothed to that young man. He will be your brother when
they are married next autumn.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb214" href="#pb214" name="pb214">214</a>]</span></p>
<p>All the afternoon there were games and merriment, and many people
came to congratulate the young people and to drink tea. As the
merriment grew louder the little boy grew tired of it, and he went to
ask his grandmother for a story. She, too, was tired of the lively
doings in the other room, and she very willingly told him about</p>

<h3 class="main">THE DESERTER</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time there was a deserter who was three
times faithless to his colors. Twice had he undergone the punishment
due to desertion; the third time, he knew, he was face to face with
death. So he resolved to flee by night and hide himself by day in some
ditch or thicket, for he was afraid that in the daylight he might be
recognized and arrested.</p>
<p>One night, as he was hastening onward, he saw a glimmer of light in
the distance, and thought to himself, &ldquo;I will go toward
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name=
"pb215">215</a>]</span>that light; perhaps it will somehow help me out
of my trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When, however, he came up to that light all he saw was an opening
just wide enough for him to creep into. The moment he was inside thick
darkness fell upon him. He could find his way neither in nor out; but
on groping around he at last came upon a staircase, up which he climbed
and found himself in a passageway. Through this passageway he went for
a long, long time, until at last he stumbled upon a door. He opened the
door and stepped into a room, but it was pitch dark there too; so he
groped all about until at last he stumbled upon another door and
entered another room.</p>
<p>So on he went through eleven rooms, and finally reached the twelfth,
where at last he found a lighted candle upon a table. The room was
beautifully fitted up, and he thought within himself, &ldquo;Come what
come <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name=
"pb216">216</a>]</span>may, I shall make myself at home in this
room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he stretched himself upon a couch. He lay there for a while lost
in thought, when, lo and behold! the table began to lay itself. When
the cloth was spread, all sorts of good cheer began to appear upon
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come what come may,&rdquo; he thought to himself again,
&ldquo;I am hungry.&rdquo; So he fell to and ate to his heart&rsquo;s
content. When he had eaten all that he could swallow he threw himself
upon the couch again and began to consider.</p>
<p>Suddenly three women entered, clothed entirely in black. One seated
herself at the piano, while the two others danced. Tired as he was,
when he saw this he arose and skipped about with them. After this
entertainment they began to talk with him, speaking of one thing and
another, and finally came round to the question how he might break the
spell that bound them. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href=
"#pb217" name="pb217">217</a>]</span></p>
<p>They told him the very way and manner of doing it, saying that he
had nothing more nor less to do than to pass the night in a certain
room which they would show him. A ghost would come there and pester him
with all sorts of questions&mdash;who he was, how he had come there,
and other things. But he must not say a mortal word to all these
questions, not though the ghost tormented him in all sorts of ways; if
he could only hold out in silence the ghost would vanish, and then he
would feel not the least pain from all the torments he had been
enduring.</p>
<p>Our deserter fell in with the proposition without further words, and
the ladies escorted him to the fateful room with the sound of music and
left him there alone. When they were gone he undressed himself, bolted
the door securely, and lay down in bed. But he could not sleep, for his
head throbbed with expectation of what was about to happen.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name=
"pb218">218</a>]</span></p>
<p>At eleven o&rsquo;clock a sudden knock was heard at the door. He
dared not make a sound, for he was firmly resolved to ransom himself,
the ladies, and the enchanted castle; so he kept as still as a mouse.
Again the knocking came, but he made no answer. At the third knock the
door flew open, and in walked a gigantic form all clothed in
flames.</p>
<p>The giant placed himself at the bedside and began to ask the man
whence he was and why he had come; but the deserter never uttered a
word. Then the giant seized him, threw him upon the floor, and began to
torment him; but no sound passed the sufferer&rsquo;s lips. At the
stroke of twelve the ghost departed, with the words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though you wouldn&rsquo;t tell to-day, you will to-morrow,
when we all three come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke, the door flew open, closed again, and he was gone. The
young man arose from the floor, lay down upon his bed, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name="pb219">219</a>]</span>and
fell sweetly asleep, without feeling the least harm.</p>
<p>Next morning came the three ladies, all in white up to their knees,
and led him, with <span class="corr" id="xd21e3683" title=
"Not in source">the</span> sound of music, back to the room where he
had been on the previous day. They placed a chair for him and set a
delicious breakfast before him. When he had plentifully breakfasted he
fell asleep and snored till evening.</p>
<p>When he awoke he asked how late it was. The ladies replied that it
was nine o&rsquo;clock; and they gave him a good supper and led him
again to the same room to sleep.</p>
<p>At the stroke of eleven some one knocked at the door. He made no
sound, but at the third knock the door flew open and three ghosts
entered. The one who had been there the night before asked him the same
questions as before, but received no better answer. Then one of them
seized him and flung him into one corner, and another into <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name=
"pb220">220</a>]</span>another, and so they tossed him about until the
poor fellow lay helpless against the wall, all covered with blood.</p>
<p>When the clock struck twelve the spokesman said to him,
&ldquo;Though you won&rsquo;t answer to-night, you will to-morrow, when
we all four come.&rdquo; With these words they disappeared.</p>
<p>He again lifted himself up, lay down upon his bed, and felt no harm.
In the morning the three ladies came, all in white up to their girdles,
and escorted him, to the sound of music, into the other room, where,
after breakfast, he again fell asleep.</p>
<p>At night they again escorted him to his chamber to sleep. When they
were gone he did not go to bed as usual, but began to consider how he
might avoid the fearful torment in store for him. First he looked out
at a window, but his gaze fell upon a frightful abyss enclosed by rocky
precipices. He went to the second window, but there it <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221" name="pb221">221</a>]</span>was
no better, but seemed to be even more fearful.</p>
<p>So nothing was left him but to heap all the furniture of the room
before the door, in hope thus to escape his tormentors. But he soon
gave up this hope, for about midnight the knocking began. He made no
answer, but at the third knock the door flew open and all the furniture
returned to its own place.</p>
<p>The ghost who had before questioned him now began to repeat his
questions, commanding him to tell who he was and how he came there; but
the young man was not to be made to speak. Then the spokesman ordered
one of his comrades to go below and bring up an anvil and four hammers,
and when these had been brought, one of the ghosts blew up a fire and
threw the young man upon it. When he was heated to a glow they laid him
upon the anvil and beat him with hammers until he was as flat as
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=
"pb222">222</a>]</span>paper. But with all this he was not to be forced
to speak.</p>
<p>The time was up and the ghosts must go. Before they went they told
him that he and all around him were blessed; and then the door flew
open and they vanished. He again arose, laid himself upon the bed, and
sank at once into slumber.</p>
<p>Next morning the three ladies, all in white from head to foot, came,
with the sound of music, to thank him for ransoming them, and they gave
him leave to choose among them for a wife. Now the youngest of them had
grown nearest his heart, and he declared himself ready to marry her,
not at once, but later, for first he wished to see something of the
world.</p>
<p>This being the case, they gave him a ham, a wooden flask of wine, a
loaf of bread, three dogs, and a pipe which hung by a golden chain, and
they told him that these dogs would come to his aid in every time of
need; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223" name=
"pb223">223</a>]</span>he had only to call them by means of his pipe.
And should he be tired, he had only to seat himself upon one of them.
So he took all these things and went forth to see the world.</p>
<p>One day when he was travelling through a forest he arrived at a
castle and turned aside to enter. But the steps which led up were of
such a kind that he could not climb them; so he seated himself upon one
of his dogs and the animal carried him up. As he passed through the
entrance he peeped through a window and saw a Tiger and his wife, who
was combing his hair.</p>
<p>He went in to where they were, and the Tiger at once arose, led him
from room to room, and showed him many wonderful things. Everything
pleased the young man, except that the Tiger&rsquo;s wife kept the dogs
shut up in a room apart.</p>
<p>When he entered the fourth room he went around it, gazing upon the
many statues <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name=
"pb224">224</a>]</span>and paintings; and while thus doing he stepped
upon a board which gave way and let him fall into a cellar where it was
as dark as pitch. He groped around for a way of escape, but a damp,
heavy wind seemed to sweep all around him, and first he would wound his
hand and then his foot. So he thought to himself, &ldquo;You
won&rsquo;t come safely out of this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a while the Tiger let himself down by a rope, butcher-knife in
hand, intending to kill him. The young man begged for a
half-hour&rsquo;s respite, that he might do penance for his sins. This
was granted, but the time soon flew by, and the Tiger was already
whetting his knife to stab him, when the young man sprang aside, and
his hand met the chain upon which the pipe was hanging. He blew upon
it, and quick as thought the dogs were on the spot. He set them upon
the Tiger, but as they fell upon him the Tiger begged humbly for life,
promising <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225" name=
"pb225">225</a>]</span>that his wife would draw him and his dogs up out
of the cellar.</p>
<p>So it came to pass; but they were no sooner out than he again set
the dogs upon the Tiger, who again began to beg, promising to give him
a salve which had the power of fastening against the wall any one upon
whose back it was rubbed, and keeping him there fast and firm until he
chose to let him go.</p>
<p>The youth took the salve and went on farther, till he reached a city
which was all shrouded in mourning. He entered and asked why every one
was in mourning, and received answer that a fearful Dragon was to come
that day and carry off the Emperor&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<p>At this he laughed heartily, and said, &ldquo;That may easily be
helped; just go and announce to the Emperor that I am ready to ransom
the Princess, if it is agreeable to him.&rdquo; This was announced, and
the Emperor <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name=
"pb226">226</a>]</span>received him into the castle with great joy.</p>
<p>As the appointed time for the Dragon&rsquo;s coming had arrived, the
young man placed himself in readiness. At the stroke of twelve the
Dragon suddenly appeared, driving four horses. The young man was
waiting for him, and as soon as the Dragon had taken the Princess by
the hand to carry her off he spread the salve upon his back, pressed
him against the wall, and set his dogs upon him. At the same time he
belabored him with the butt-end of his musket, till the Dragon was
quite exhausted and began to beg off, promising to give a written
agreement never again to molest the Princess. When he had written the
paper in his own blood and signed it he vanished through the
window.</p>
<p>Then the Emperor knew not what to do for joy. He offered his
daughter to the soldier to wife, or, if he liked it better, the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227" name=
"pb227">227</a>]</span>half of his kingdom. But the young man declined
both offers and returned to his own ladies, where he married the
youngest with the greatest festivities. As they came out of church to
go to their house a new city sprang up all along the roadside. The
hilarity was great. I myself was among the guests, and after I had made
merry to my heart&rsquo;s content I set out upon the way home to
Varazdin.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever live in Varazdin, grandmother?&rdquo; asked the
little boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, surely not,&rdquo; said the grandmother. &ldquo;That is
just the way the story ends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the little boy. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="first">Spring was coming on finely, and everybody was at work
in the fields&mdash;everybody, that is, who was not in the army. From
every one of the wooden houses that stood on either side of the
highway, with their gable ends to the street, had gone a son, a
husband, a laborer to the war that was waging so fiercely, no one quite
knew where. The little boy&rsquo;s married brother had gone to the
nearest garrison town. He had barely had time to make the acquaintance
of his little new-born daughter when he was summoned. He went very
willingly&mdash;all of them did. There was not a man in the village who
did not adore the Emperor, who was not ready to die for him, though not
one of them had ever seen him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229"
href="#pb229" name="pb229">229</a>]</span></p>
<p>So there were few men to work in the fields, and all the women and
girls must go. This they were used to; it was so every year. The little
boy&rsquo;s mother was there, and his sisters, the eldest one wearing
in her hair the flowers that showed that she was betrothed. As far as
one could see over the wide, treeless plain there were women and girls
working, with only here and there a man who, like the <i>starosta</i>,
was needed for the affairs of the village, or who, like the
<i>moujiks</i> who looked after the sheep, were too old to go.</p>
<p>The little boy was very proud when his father let him go to the
field and help drop the seed into the furrows. He was thus at work when
an old <i>moujik</i> came along and stood watching them. He was a very
ragged old <i>moujik</i>, for he was very poor; but he was a polite old
man, as all Russian peasants are, and when the little boy&rsquo;s
mother came along with her hoe, covering <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb230" href="#pb230" name="pb230">230</a>]</span>up the seed, he
lifted his greasy old <i>shapka</i> to her with great courtesy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing that the little boy is at
work,&rdquo; said the old <i>moujik</i>. &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t begin
too early. There is much to do in God&rsquo;s blessed world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is only for a little while,&rdquo; said the mother.
&ldquo;I shall send him to school soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, school, school!&rdquo; said the old <i>moujik</i>,
shaking his head. &ldquo;It only takes the children&rsquo;s time when
they ought to be at work; it costs money, and what good does it do?
There were no schools in my time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little boy was tired when dinner-time came, and his mother left
him at home with the grandmother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been working hard, little grandma,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I deserve a story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; said the grandmother, and there was a
twinkle in her eyes. &ldquo;Did I ever tell you about <span class=

<h3 class="main">&ldquo;THE WATCH-TOWER BETWEEN EARTH AND
HEAVEN&rdquo;</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time there was a King who had three sons
and one daughter. He kept the daughter in a cage and guarded her as the
eyes in his head.</p>
<p>When the maiden was grown up she begged her father one evening to
let her go out and take a walk before the castle with her brothers. The
father consented, but hardly was she out of the door when suddenly a
Dragon came swooping down from the sky, seized the maiden from among
her brothers, and carried her away with him high into the clouds.</p>
<p>The brothers rushed headlong back to their father, told him of their
misfortune, and begged permission to go and seek their stolen sister.
The father consented, gave <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href=
"#pb233" name="pb233">233</a>]</span>them each a horse and everything
needful for a journey, and they set out.</p>
<p>After many wanderings they came across a watch-tower which stood
neither on earth nor in heaven. When they reached the place it occurred
to them that their sister might be within, and they at once began to
take counsel among themselves as to how they should reach it.</p>
<p>After long consultation they decided to kill one of their horses,
cut his skin into a long strap, fasten the end to an arrow, and shoot
it up into some place in the watch-tower where it would hold securely.
Then they could easily climb up. The two younger brothers asked the
eldest to sacrifice his horse, but he would not; nor would the second
brother. So the youngest brother slew his horse, cut the hide into a
long strap, bound one end to his arrow, and with his bow shot it up
into the tower.</p>
<p>But now, when it came to climbing up by <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name="pb234">234</a>]</span>the
strap, the eldest and second brothers declined, whereupon the youngest
undertook the adventure. Arriving at the tower, he went from room to
room, until at last he came to one where he saw his sister sitting,
with the Dragon&rsquo;s head in her lap, the Dragon being fast
asleep.</p>
<p>When the sister perceived her brother she was greatly terrified, and
softly entreated him to flee before the Dragon should awake. This he
would not do, but seized his cudgel, struck out boldly, and dealt the
Dragon a heavy blow upon the head. The Dragon, without awaking, put his
hand up to the spot, murmuring, &ldquo;Something hit me right
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he said this the Prince fetched him a second blow upon the head,
and again the Dragon murmured, &ldquo;Something hit me here.&rdquo; But
now, as the brother made ready to strike a third time, the sister made
a sign showing the Dragon&rsquo;s vulnerable spot, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235" name="pb235">235</a>]</span>the
brother, giving a powerful blow, killed him as dead as a mouse.</p>
<p>Then the Princess pushed him from her, flew into her brother&rsquo;s
arms, and smothered him with kisses. After this she took him by the
hand and began to lead him through all the rooms. First she led him
into a room in which a black fox, with a harness of pure silver, was
standing before a manger. Then she led him into another room, where a
white horse, with a harness of pure gold, stood before another manger.
Finally she led him into a third room, where a brown horse stood before
a manger, his harness all studded with diamonds.</p>
<p>When they had gone through these rooms, the sister led her brother
into a chamber where a maiden sat before a golden embroidery-frame,
working with golden threads. From this room she led him into another,
where a second maiden was spinning gold thread, and at last into a room
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236" name=
"pb236">236</a>]</span>where a third maiden was stringing pearls, while
at her feet a golden hen, with a brood of chickens, was picking up
pearls from a golden basin.</p>
<p>When they had gone through all these rooms and seen all they wanted
to see, they went back into the room where the dead Dragon lay, dragged
him out, and threw him head-foremost down to the earth. When the other
brothers saw him they were almost convulsed with terror. But now the
youngest brother let down to them first their sister and then the three
maidens, one after another, each with her work. As he let them down he
allotted one to each of his brothers, and when he let down the third,
that is, the one with the hen and chickens, he reserved her to
himself.</p>
<p>But his brothers, filled with envy because he was the hero who had
discovered all these things and rescued their sister, cut the strap to
make it impossible for him to return. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb237" href="#pb237" name="pb237">237</a>]</span>Then they rode away,
and coming upon a shepherd-boy with his sheep, they dressed him like
their brother and brought him home to their father, forbidding their
sister and the maidens, with fearful threats, under any circumstances
to reveal the secret.</p>
<p>After a time word came to the youngest brother in the tower that his
brothers and the shepherd were about to marry those three maidens. On
the day appointed for the eldest brother&rsquo;s wedding he mounted the
white horse and flew down into the midst of the wedding-guests just as
they were leaving the church, and struck his brother lightly upon the
back with his club. The brother fell from his horse, and the other flew
back to his watch-tower.</p>
<p>When the second brother&rsquo;s wedding-day came he again flew down
upon his steed, gave the second brother a blow upon the back, so that
he fell from his horse, and again flew away. But when he at last heard
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name=
"pb238">238</a>]</span>that the shepherd was about to marry the third
maiden he again mounted his steed, flew among the wedding-guests just
as they were coming out of the church, and dealt the bridegroom such a
blow upon the head with his club that the fellow lay dead upon the
spot.</p>
<p>In a trice the Prince was surrounded by the wedding-guests, who were
determined that he should not escape this time. He made no attempt to
do so, however, but remained where he was, made himself known as the
King&rsquo;s youngest son, revealed the trick his brothers had played
upon him by means of the shepherd, and told how they had left him in
the watch-tower where he had found his sister and killed the
Dragon.</p>
<p>His sister and the maidens bore witness to the truth of his story,
and when the King heard all this he banished the two elder brothers
from his presence, married the youngest to the maiden of his choice,
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name=
"pb239">239</a>]</span>decreed that he should be heir to the throne
after his own decease.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;That is a real story, grandmother,&rdquo; said the little
boy. &ldquo;But it was not so very long. Couldn&rsquo;t you tell me
just one more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will promise not to ask for another,&rdquo; said the
grandmother, &ldquo;I will tell you a short one. But you must not ask
for another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; said the little boy.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time there was a man who had a grown-up
son. One day the old man said to his son, &ldquo;My dear son, you are
now big and strong enough to earn your own living; so go out into the
world and seek a place of service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the youth went out into the world and came to a large village,
where he hired himself <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href=
"#pb240" name="pb240">240</a>]</span>out as shepherd to a rich
<i>moujik</i>. It was his duty to drive the sheep to pasture early
every morning. The flock was enormously large and filled the whole
valley. The pasture, however, was on the other side of a stream, and
unluckily a storm had carried away the bridge the night before. Only a
narrow plank remained, and this was so frail that but one sheep could
cross at a time. There was nothing else for the shepherd to do,
therefore, than to drive the sheep slowly, one by one, to the other
side.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Here the grandmother got up and went to the stove as if she had
finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, grandmother,&rdquo; said the little boy, &ldquo;what
happened next? Tell the rest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The grandmother laughed. &ldquo;Wait until the shepherd has driven
all the sheep over the bridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but when will that be?&rdquo; asked the little boy.</p>

<h2 class="main">TRINITY-MONDAY</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">You would hardly know the village. As you looked down
the street it would seem as if a forest of tall masts and poles had
suddenly sprung up. Before every house they stood, two tall
uprights&mdash;very, very tall&mdash;with a beam across the top, and
from the beam two very long poles hanging, with a board connecting the
lower ends. Yes, they were swings, but not swings like yours, for they
were made of these long, long poles instead of ropes.</p>
<p>The sun was hardly up when the little boy came out of the court and
made a dash for the swing. There were boys and girls on every swing as
far as you could see down the street, and in some of them were fathers
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href="#pb243" name=
"pb243">243</a>]</span>and mothers, too, for Trinity-Monday is a great
holiday, and no one works who is not obliged to.</p>
<p>It was still very early. The hot mid-summer sun had hardly peeped
above the distant hills. The little boy had a long, long day for
swinging.</p>
<p>In the swing next door were three children standing up, and their
father with them, swinging very high and shouting joyously. The father,
in a very loud, deep voice, would shout a long
&ldquo;Boo-oo-oo-m!&rdquo; and then the children would cry, in their
shrill treble, &ldquo;Hurra-a-a-r!&rdquo; with a long roll of the
&ldquo;r.&rdquo; All down the street they were &ldquo;boom&rdquo;-ing
and &ldquo;hurra-a-a-r&rdquo;-ing; it was a beautiful noise.</p>
<p>The sisters came running out, and after them the brother and the
father. And what swing went so high as the little boy&rsquo;s swing?
And from before which house was there so deep a
&ldquo;Boo-oo-oo-m!&rdquo; or so shrill and joyous <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name="pb244">244</a>]</span>a
&ldquo;Hurra-a-a-r!&rdquo;? The fun went on all day, the children
visiting from swing to swing, and the fathers and mothers taking a turn
now and again. What a joyful Trinity-Monday!</p>
<p>The grandmothers did not swing. They sat in the house-doors with the
babies of the young mothers or took their knitting and exchanged calls
with one another. The long day seemed very short even to them.</p>
<p>By the time sunset came the little boy was thoroughly tired out with
delight. He came and lay down on the bench in the court where the
grandmother was sitting. For once her hands were idle. She was thinking
of her own swinging days, a long, long time ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is time for a story,&rdquo; said the little boy,
&ldquo;and you are doing nothing, little grandmamma.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">SO BORN, SO DIE</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In olden times, when all the world believed in
Christianity, there lived in India a pious Christian. This man resolved
to lead a hermit&rsquo;s life; and, as he was wandering up and down
through India, he found a great cave, where he took up his abode, that
he might lead a life wholly pleasing to God. Thus passed away many
years while he dwelt in the solitude of the wilderness, far from any
living soul.</p>
<p>One evening, when he had said his evening prayer and lain down upon
his bed of moss, he thought in his heart, &ldquo;O Thou my God! I have
already tarried many years in this solitude, and it has never been
vouchsafed to me to convert a single soul to Thy holy faith. For in the
many years which I have spent here I have seen no human being nor any
living creature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While thinking thus the Hermit stretched <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246" name=
"pb246">246</a>]</span>himself upon his bed and sweet sleep fell upon
his eyelids. He awoke at daybreak, said his morning prayer, and then
became aware of a little Mouse, which looked confidingly at him and
glided toward him into the cave.</p>
<p>Then said the Hermit, &ldquo;Praise and glory to Thee, O God, that I
again look upon one of Thy creatures!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little by little there grew up between the Mouse and the Hermit such
a warm friendship that the two were perfectly inseparable. The hoary
Hermit derived the greatest joy from this friendship, and he constantly
besought God to transform the little Mouse into a young girl, to be a
daughter to him.</p>
<p>His prayer was answered; the little Mouse became a fair young girl,
and the old man felt at last that his life would not have been spent in
vain, since it was vouchsafed to him to instruct this creature of God
in the good and right way. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href=
"#pb247" name="pb247">247</a>]</span></p>
<p>So passed away the Hermit&rsquo;s life in peace and piety until the
young girl had attained the full bloom of maidenhood. Then thought the
Hermit:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am already full of days; I have lived always to the glory
of God, and the end of my life draws near. It would be a sin if this
beautiful creature of God, who knows nothing of the world, should be
left to grow old and wither away in this solitary vale. It would be
better that she should marry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Impelled by this thought, he called the maiden to him and said,
&ldquo;My little daughter, you are now grown up and old enough to be
married. You ought also to see the world, for this place where we live
is not the whole world. The world is large, and there are in it many
beautiful creatures of God whom you have never seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The maiden answered, &ldquo;I thank you, my father; may your will be
done in each and every thing. Only let me make one request,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name=
"pb248">248</a>]</span>that you will find me a husband to my liking,
and, before all things, let him be that creature of God which is
stronger than any other in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Hermit consented and set off upon his quest. In the course of
his journey he met the Moon, and greeted him with, &ldquo;God be with
thee, thou holy Moon, strongest of all God&rsquo;s creatures! I have a
daughter; take her for thy wife!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Moon answered, &ldquo;What foolish talk is this? I the strongest
of God&rsquo;s creatures! I shine in the night, but as soon as the Sun
overtakes me he robs me of my light. Address yourself to the Sun; he is
stronger than I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Hermit now betook himself to the Sun, and said, &ldquo;God be
with thee, O strong and shining Sun! Thou art the strongest of all
God&rsquo;s creatures. I have a daughter; take her for thy
wife!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the Sun replied, &ldquo;Thou errest in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name=
"pb249">249</a>]</span>taking me for the strongest. The clouds are
stronger and mightier than I, for when I shed abroad my rays then the
clouds unroll themselves and veil my splendor. So they are stronger
than I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Hermit sought a Cloud, and greeted him with, &ldquo;God be
with thee!&rdquo; and said, &ldquo;Thou Cloud-man, strongest and
mightiest of all God&rsquo;s creatures, I have a daughter; take her for
thy wife!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the Cloud-man answered, &ldquo;That cannot be, for the Wind is
stronger than I. When I spread myself over the bright expanse of
heaven, then comes the Wind and tears me into countless fragments. Go
to the Wind; he is stronger than I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Hermit betook himself to the Wind, hailed him with, &ldquo;God
be with thee!&rdquo; and said, &ldquo;Thou mightiest of all God&rsquo;s
creatures, strongest of all in the world, take my daughter for thy
wife!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Wind answered, &ldquo;Oh, old man, how <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name=
"pb250">250</a>]</span>should I be the strongest? When I begin to blow,
the Mountain stands in my way, so that the people on its farther side
know nothing about me. Go to the Mountain; he is stronger than
I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man went to the Mountain and said, &ldquo;God be with thee,
thou rocky Mountain, strongest thing in the world! I have a daughter;
take her for thy wife!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oho, old man!&rdquo; answered the Mountain, &ldquo;do you
imagine that I am the strongest in the world? Don&rsquo;t you see me
riddled all over by mice, who burrow in me night and day? Search for a
Mouse, for he is stronger than I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the old man went to a Mouse, and said, &ldquo;Thou strongest of
all God&rsquo;s creatures, I have a daughter; take her for thy
wife!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not unwilling,&rdquo; answered the Mouse, &ldquo;but I
have not yet seen the maiden. Bring her here first, that I may see her;
then will I wed her.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href=
"#pb251" name="pb251">251</a>]</span></p>
<p>The old Hermit returned home and said, &ldquo;Well, my little
daughter, I have found a husband for you; follow me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They presented themselves before the Mouse, and the old Hermit said,
&ldquo;Here is thy wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oho, what shall I do with her?&rdquo; asked the Mouse.
&ldquo;She cannot even get into my little palace!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the maiden said to the old man, &ldquo;This shall be my husband;
only pray to God to transform me again into a Mouse, that I may go with
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old Hermit, who saw no help for it, fell upon his knees and
begged God to restore his daughter to her former state. That very
moment the maiden was changed into a Mouse and went with her
husband.</p>
<p>As for the old Hermit, he still lived on piously till the end of his
days, convinced that every one must die with the same nature with which
he was born. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name=

<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;I should like to go to the sun, grandmother,&rdquo; said the
little boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would find it very hot,&rdquo; said the grandmother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever go, little grandma?&rdquo; asked the little
boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one goes nowadays,&rdquo; said the grandmother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They went in your great-grandmother&rsquo;s time?&rdquo;
ventured the little boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before her time, even,&rdquo; said the grandmother.
&ldquo;Things are greatly changed since then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The younger sisters had come in from swinging and were sitting on
the other end of the bench. The eldest sister was walking with her
betrothed in the lovely summer twilight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one ever went to the sun,&rdquo; said one of the sisters.
&ldquo;It is much too far off. I have learned it in school. And this
world goes around it every day.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb253" href="#pb253" name="pb253">253</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;There were no schools in your great-grandmother&rsquo;s
time,&rdquo; replied the grandmother, &ldquo;and things were different
then. The world did not move in those days; it rested on three great
whales which were swimming in the ocean. My grandmother told me all
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little boy pondered this fact for a while. Presently he
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more story, little grandmother?&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">THE ENCHANTED LAMBS</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">An Emperor once had an only daughter of surpassing
beauty. In his pride he caused it to be sounded abroad through all the
world that the youth who should guess the position of a certain mole on
the maiden&rsquo;s person should have her for his wife, and the half of
his empire besides. But those <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254"
href="#pb254" name="pb254">254</a>]</span>who did not guess right
should be transformed into lambs.</p>
<p>This wonderful news spread over the whole world, so that wooers by
thousands came from all lands to sue for the Princess&rsquo;s hand. But
all in vain. A countless number of them were changed into lambs.</p>
<p>The news came also to the ears of a youth who was as poor as a
church mouse, but who was as sharp as a needle for all that. His desire
to possess the beautiful maiden and half the empire grew so strong that
he decided to try his fortune; not, however, by suing at once for the
maiden&rsquo;s hand, but by seeing her first and asking her
something.</p>
<p>Arrived at the Emperor&rsquo;s court, what wonders does he see!
Lambs of all kinds pressed around him&mdash;God only knows how many
there were.</p>
<p>They swarmed about him, a pitiful sight and a warning example that
might well turn him from his project. He would have <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255" name="pb255">255</a>]</span>gone
back, but at the gate was a monster of a man, wrapped in a blood-red
mantle, with wings, and an eye in the middle of his forehead, who cried
out in a commanding voice, &ldquo;Halt! Where are you going? Go back,
or you are lost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he went back and caused himself to be announced to the
Emperor&rsquo;s daughter, who was already waiting for him. She said to
him, &ldquo;Did you come to get me for your wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He answered, &ldquo;No, Imperial Highness; but as I understood that
you were thinking of marrying at the first favorable opportunity, I
come to ask you if you need more bridal-clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of clothes have you to offer?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>He answered, &ldquo;I have a skirt of marble, a bodice of dew, a
head-dress of threads made from the sun&rsquo;s rays, with a clasp of
the moon and stars; then I have shoes of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb256" href="#pb256" name="pb256">256</a>]</span>pure gold which were
neither sewed nor made by a smith. So, tell me, do you wish to buy
these things or not? You have but to command, and I will bring them to
you, but only on one condition. When you try these things on, piece by
piece, there shall be no one present but only us two. If they fit we
shall soon come to terms; if not, I will never offer them to another
soul, but will lay them aside and keep them for my own
bride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess agreed to this condition and gave him the order to
bring the garments. And, really, he brought them to her. God only knows
where he found them and how he came to possess them; it is enough for
us to know that he kept his word.</p>
<p>They shut themselves up in a room, and first she tried on the skirt,
while he watched narrowly to see if by chance he could discover the
mole. To his joy he saw it under her right knee&mdash;a little golden
star; but not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257" name=
"pb257">257</a>]</span>the slightest change in his face betrayed his
discovery. He only thought in his heart, &ldquo;It is well for me
to-day and for all time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Princess tried on the bodice and all the other things, and
they fitted her as if she had been poured into them. They agreed as to
the price; she paid it on the spot; he packed up his gold and
departed.</p>
<p>After a few days, having dressed himself in the finest suit that
could be bought for money, he came back to sue for the hand of the
Emperor&rsquo;s daughter. When he appeared before the Emperor he said,
&ldquo;Worthy Emperor, I come to woo your daughter. Make no objections;
give her to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; answered the Emperor; &ldquo;but do you know how
my daughter&rsquo;s hand is won? Take good care, for if you do not
guess the mole you are lost; but if you do guess it she will be yours,
and the half of my empire into the bargain.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258" name="pb258">258</a>]</span></p>
<p>The youth bowed to the Emperor and said, &ldquo;My greetings, O
Emperor and father-in-law! If that is the case she is mine. She has a
little star under the right knee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Emperor was not a little surprised that he could know this, but
there was nothing for it but to yield, and so the youth was married to
the Princess.</p>
<p>When the Emperor proceeded to give him the half of his empire the
new-made son-in-law said to him, &ldquo;I willingly leave this half of
your empire to you if you are ready to restore these poor souls to
their former condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Emperor answered that this was no longer in his power, but lay
in the hands of his daughter, &ldquo;who now,&rdquo; he added,
&ldquo;is your wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he turned to his wife with this request, and she answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut the vein under the famous mole. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259" name="pb259">259</a>]</span>Let
every lamb touch the end of its tongue to the blood and moisten its
underlip with it, and they will all be changed to men and live as
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did as she directed, and when the lambs had all assumed the forms
of men again they were invited as wedding-guests.</p>
<p>Thus the youth took the maiden home amid song and chime of bells,
and there he treated everybody royally to meat and drink, until finally
they took their homeward way. But he stayed there with his young wife,
and God knows what fortunes they met with in life that are all
forgotten now.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry you have forgotten anything, grandmother,&rdquo;
said the little boy. &ldquo;It is not dark yet, and I wanted a longer
story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not I who forgot,&rdquo; answered the grandmother.
&ldquo;I remember every word as it was told to me.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name="pb260">260</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been your great-grandmother,&rdquo; observed the
little boy. &ldquo;I wish she had had a better memory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you a short story to make up,&rdquo; said the
grandmother. &ldquo;It explains why there is so much
knot-grass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to know that,&rdquo; said one of the sisters.
&ldquo;My fingers are tired rooting it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the grandmother told about</p>

<h3 class="main">THE KNOT-GRASS</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time an old hag got up early and went out
among the mountains to gather all sorts of green herbs and practise her
sorceries.</p>
<p>About midday she set out upon her return, and met some Knot-grass
hastening to the mountains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! whither away?&rdquo; asked the witch. &ldquo;What bad
luck sends you on this rough road?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb261" href="#pb261" name="pb261">261</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word, little mother, I can&rsquo;t stand it down
there any longer! Wherever the <i>moujik</i> digs or ploughs he does
his best to root me out, tearing and clawing me with all his might.
There is nothing left for me but to flee away and seek some quiet place
where I can grow and spread in peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go back to your home, little grass,&rdquo; replied the old
hag. &ldquo;Mark my words, the more they dig and hoe about a plant the
better it thrives and the more it spreads. What does the proverb say?
&lsquo;Woe to the thing that never is harvested!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Knot-grass turned about, and ever since that day it has been
found in meadow and field, in vineyard and garden&mdash;everywhere,
indeed, where it is not wanted; and it is a hard matter to root it out.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h2 class="main">THRESHING-TIME</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was the joyous threshing-time. The summer&rsquo;s
work was over. The harvest had been good, and from all the fields the
high-piled carts were bringing the sheaves to the threshing-floors. On
these high levels busy flails were flying, making a quick music that
chimed well with the sweet, melancholy threshing-song of the girls who
were gathering the wind-swept grain into bags. When the threshing was
all done the little boy&rsquo;s eldest sister would be married, for
autumn is the time for marriages, when vegetables and pork are plenty
and there is money to buy brandy from the Jew.</p>
<p>The grandmother had gone out with the little boy to see the
threshing and to hear <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href=
"#pb263" name="pb263">263</a>]</span>the threshing-song. She had sung
that same song in her young days, and so had her great-grandmother
before her. On the way back to the house a cow-herd woman met
them&mdash;not their own, but that of a neighbor&mdash;and told them
that her old master, the <i>bolshak</i>, or head of the family, was
dead. The grandmother looked terror-stricken, and hastily
exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;May the Saviour&rsquo;s cross be with thee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cow-herd woman went on her way to spread the news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you say that, grandmother?&rdquo; asked the little
boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To scare away the death angel,&rdquo; replied the
grandmother. &ldquo;Never forget to say that when any one tells you of
a death; otherwise it may come to your own house next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The grandmother seemed sad when she reached home. She had known the
old man when she was a girl. He had been a stern <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264" name="pb264">264</a>]</span>and
severe <i>bolshak</i> in his family, keeping all his married sons at
home and making them work hard for him, not at all like her son, the
<i>starosta</i>, who was so kind to his children. Nevertheless, it made
her sad that he was dead. She sat quiet, distaff and spindle lying idly
in her lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandmother,&rdquo; said the little boy, &ldquo;would it
comfort you to tell me a story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed it would,&rdquo; said the grandmother. &ldquo;Come
now, sit on that stool and hold this yarn for me, and I will tell you
about</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">&ldquo;THE THREE EELS.&rdquo;</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time there was a fisherman who on three
successive days made out to catch only an eel a day. When he found only
one eel in his net on the third day he cried out angrily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of fishing when one gets nothing more
than one eel day after day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immediately the tongue of one of the eels <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265" name="pb265">265</a>]</span>was
loosed, and he said, &ldquo;Wretched man, you little know what a
precious catch you have had! You have fished up great good luck for
yourself. Only now do as I advise you: Kill one of us three and divide
him into four parts; give one piece to your wife to eat, the second to
the mother-dog, the third to the mare, and bury the fourth in the
ground just above your house. Soon your wife will bring twins into the
world, the dog two pups, the mare two full-blooded stallions, and above
your house will spring up two golden swords.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fisherman followed the Eel&rsquo;s advice, and indeed in the
course of time everything happened as the Eel had predicted&mdash;his
wife bore twins, the dog two pups, the mare two full-blooded stallions,
and above his house two golden swords sprang up.</p>
<p>When the sons grew large and had passed a certain number of years,
one of them said to his father, &ldquo;Father, I perceive that you
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266" name=
"pb266">266</a>]</span>are a poor man and cannot keep us any longer; so
let me take a horse, a dog, and a sword, and go forth into the world. I
am young and need experience; and where my head may rest, there also
will my food be found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he had thus spoken he turned to his brother with the words,
&ldquo;Brother, God keep you! I go to seek my fortune. Do you stay at
home, work, make, and save, and honor our father. Take this vial of
water and give good heed to it, for if the water in it becomes dark it
will be a sure sign that I have perished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus he spoke and went to seek his fortune.</p>
<p>In the course of his wanderings he came to a great city, where the
King&rsquo;s daughter saw him as he was taking a walk about the town.
She at once fell desperately in love with him, and begged her father to
invite him to the house. This he did. When the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267" name=
"pb267">267</a>]</span>youth entered the King&rsquo;s apartments, and
the maiden saw the sword, the dog, and the horse near by, she found
everything on and about him so fine that it seemed to her nothing in
the whole world could be finer. She fell more madly in love with him
than ever, and said to her father, &ldquo;Father, I want to marry that
youth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King was very well pleased, the young man had nothing against
it, so the bargain was concluded and the marriage celebrated according
to form and custom.</p>
<p>One evening, as the youth stood at the window with his wife, he
noticed in the distance a large mountain which was all a light blaze.
He asked his wife what was the cause of this, and she answered,
&ldquo;Oh, sir, do not ask me! That is a magic mountain that spits
lightnings by day and at night stands wreathed in flames, and whoever
goes there to see what is the matter is instantly struck dumb and
remains enchanted on the spot.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb268" href="#pb268" name="pb268">268</a>]</span></p>
<p>He paid no heed to her words, but mounted his horse, girded on his
sword, called his dog, and rode to the mountain. When he reached it he
met an old woman perched on a rock, holding in one hand a staff and in
the other a little weed. As soon as he saw her he asked her why the
mountain had these peculiarities, and she told him to ride along and he
would soon find out.</p>
<p>He did so, and the old woman conducted him to a court hedged in with
the bones of heroes, and around in the court were countless men
standing stark and stiff, all enchanted. He had hardly stepped into
this court when he, too, as also his horse and his dog, grew rigid and
changed to stone on the spot where they stood.</p>
<p>At the same moment the water in the brother&rsquo;s bottle at home
grew dark, and the brother announced to the father and mother that his
brother, their son, was dead and that he must go abroad and seek him.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269" name=
"pb269">269</a>]</span></p>
<p>So he travelled from place to place and from city to city, until
luck took him to that very town and to the King&rsquo;s palace. At
sight of him the King rushed to his daughter with the good news,
&ldquo;Your husband has returned!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ran down to meet him, and thought he was her husband, for the
two brothers were as much alike as the two halves of a cut apple. She
thought it was the same horse, the same dog, and the same sword; and
father and daughter rushed joyfully to meet him. They kissed and
caressed him, the King thinking that it was his son-in-law, the
daughter thinking that it was her husband.</p>
<p>The youth was at first quite bewildered by these signs of affection,
but it occurred to him that they were for his brother, and so he
feigned to be her husband and the King&rsquo;s son-in-law.</p>
<p>When night came they retired, but he laid <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270" name="pb270">270</a>]</span>his
drawn sword in the bed between them. The woman wondered at this, but he
said he could not sleep, and arose and went to the window. At sight of
the magic mountain he said, &ldquo;Tell me, my dear little wife, why is
that mountain in flames?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; answered she, &ldquo;did I
not tell you that other evening of the peculiarities of that
mountain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he asked her again, and she
answered, &ldquo;Every one who goes there is enchanted and turned to
stone. I was in great fear during your absence that you had gone
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he heard this he guessed the trouble, and in his anxiety he
could hardly wait for daybreak. As soon as it was light he mounted his
horse, girded on his sword, called to his dog, and rode to the
mountain. When he saw the old woman he drew his sword from the
scabbard, spurred on his horse, and set the dog upon her without saying
a word. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271" name=
"pb271">271</a>]</span>The old woman fell back in a fury and called out
to him not to cut her down. He answered, &ldquo;Then give me back my
brother!&rdquo; Hereupon the old woman led his brother out and restored
to him speech and soul.</p>
<p>When the brothers had greeted each other, and asked after each
other&rsquo;s health, they turned back homeward. But on the way the one
who had been enchanted said, &ldquo;O brother, come! Let us turn back
and deliver those men from perdition&mdash;those who are enchanted as I
was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No sooner said than done. They turn around, seize the old woman,
snatch from her the little weed, and begin to strike the enchanted men
with it, until by degrees all of them begin to speak and move. When all
those enchanted ones had been called back into life they killed the old
witch. The twin brothers went back to the King&rsquo;s palace and all
the others to their houses. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href=

<p>I have heard a lie, I have told a lie, and God give you joy!</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;Why do you say that, grandmother?&rdquo; asked the little
boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the way it ends,&rdquo; said the grandmother.

<h2 class="main">THE KOROWAI</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There were great doings in the little boy&rsquo;s
house. Grandmother was standing at the long table beating up the dough
of the <i>korowai</i> for the eldest sister&rsquo;s wedding, for
grandmother was greatly skilled in the making of wedding-cakes. No part
of the wedding-feast is so important as the <i>korowai</i>, and the
little boy watched with great interest as she mixed together the flour
and eggs and lard, the molasses and fruit, the saffron and the savory
seeds that go to make <i>korowai</i>. He was surprised and somewhat
disappointed when, instead of putting it into the oven to bake, she
spread a cloth over the great bowl and set it on a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href="#pb274" name=
"pb274">274</a>]</span>chair by the stove. He was impatient to have it
baked, it smelled so nice already!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to bake it, grandmother?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not just yet,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;It must rise
first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went away to her room, giving strict injunctions to be called as
soon as the dough was risen enough.</p>
<p>The little boy did not follow her. Other things were being done in
his mother&rsquo;s room: vegetables and apples were being pared, pork
roasted, sausages stuffed&mdash;it was very exciting. Some of the
neighbor-women had come to help, and the little boy was under
everybody&rsquo;s feet at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run away, little boy,&rdquo; said the mother; &ldquo;go ask
grandmother to tell you a story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grandmother was quite ready. She was not spinning, she was only
resting, for she had long been on her feet over the <i>korowai</i>. So
everything was favorable for the story of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h3 class="main">MORNING-DEW</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once there were three brothers whose father gave each
of them a loaf of bread and sent them to seek their fortune. When they
were a good way from home, and began to feel hungry, the two elder
brothers said to the youngest, whom they had always taken for a
simpleton, &ldquo;Let us first eat your bread, and then we will give
you some of ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youngest willingly shared his bread with them; but on the next
day, when it was time to eat, the two brothers ate their bread
comfortably without offering the other a single bit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why don&rsquo;t you give me a piece of bread, when you
have eaten mine all up?&rdquo; he asked, and received the answer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want to get anything from us you must let us put out
your eyes, that we <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276"
name="pb276">276</a>]</span>may go around with you begging and so earn
our bread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What could the poor wretch do? He was tortured with hunger, so he
allowed them to put out his eyes. But the brothers led him out among
the high mountains, left him there in the lurch, and went on to seek
their fortune.</p>
<p>Now was the poor fellow neither to help nor to counsel. At last
night closed in, and the Vilas came to dance in a ring, and one of them
said, &ldquo;If that man should anoint his eyes with morning-dew he
would see again that very moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had hardly heard the words when he began to grope about in the
grass for dew, and he rubbed it on his eyes and saw again. Then he
filled a glass with this dew and went on to seek his fortune.</p>
<p>On the way he stumbled across a Mouse which was staggering around,
for the poor thing was blind. So he wet her eyes with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277" name=
"pb277">277</a>]</span>morning-dew and she at once received her sight.
The little Mouse thanked him, saying, &ldquo;God reward you until I
have an opportunity to show my gratitude!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little farther on his way he came upon a Bee which was tumbling
around and weeping bitterly, for it was blind. So he anointed the
Bee&rsquo;s eyes, too, and it immediately regained its sight and
thanked him, saying, &ldquo;God reward you until I have an opportunity
to prove my gratitude!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little farther he found a Dove rolling around in the sand. He
asked her, &ldquo;What is the matter that you tumble around so in the
sand?&rdquo; And the Dove replied, &ldquo;Why do you tease me with
questions when you cannot help me?&rdquo; But the youth answered,
&ldquo;Keep quiet a moment,&rdquo; and he anointed her eyes.
Immediately she saw again, and said, &ldquo;God reward you until I have
an opportunity to repay you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He now resumed his journey, and at last <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name=
"pb278">278</a>]</span>arrived in a city where, as it happened, his two
brothers were in service. Here he also was lucky enough to hire himself
out as shepherd.</p>
<p>The brothers recognized him, and one day, when he was out in the
fields, they lied to their master, telling him that the shepherd had
boasted that he was able to reap all the cuckoo-corn<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e4324src" href="#xd21e4324" name="xd21e4324src">1</a> in a
single night. This pleased the master much, and he commanded the youth
to do this thing or it would cost him his head.</p>
<p>Weeping, he went out and threw himself down upon the grass. Then
came the little Mouse and comforted him, telling him to go to sleep and
the work should all be done. And there came a great number of mice and
gnawed down the whole crop of cuckoo-corn, so that when the youth awoke
in the morning he found all done. And he showed it to the master, who
was greatly pleased. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279"
name="pb279">279</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then the brothers came to his master and accused him of having said
that he could build a church in a single night. In the morning when he
came home he was told that he must accomplish this work or it would
cost him his head. So he threw himself down again, weeping, in the
grass.</p>
<p>Then the Bee flew by and bade him go peacefully to sleep and she and
her friends would do all the work without troubling him. And there came
thousands of swarms of bees and built a church out of wax. It was still
night when the master woke and saw a bright light over everything. He
was frightened and called his body-servant to go with him into the
church, which was already finished, even to the altars and everything
else.</p>
<p>Then the brothers told their master another lie&mdash;how the
shepherd had said that he would give a string of pearls to the daughter
of the house, and that next morning the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb280" href="#pb280" name="pb280">280</a>]</span>master&rsquo;s little
son should play with a golden apple. When he came home he was told that
he must do what he had boasted that he could do, on pain of death.</p>
<p>Weeping, he threw himself down in the grass, when the Dove came
flying to him and said, &ldquo;Dry your tears and go to rest; all shall
be done.&rdquo; In the morning the youth found a beautiful string of
pearls and a golden apple by his side, and he gave them to his
master&rsquo;s daughter and little son.</p>
<p>Then the master called the youth into his room and asked him how he
had managed to do all these things. So the youth told him how his
brothers had taken away his bread, put out his eyes, abandoned him in
the mountains, and everything else that had happened. Then the master
had the two brothers called into his presence and caused them to be
beheaded. But the youth he rewarded and gave him his daughter to
wife.</p>
<p>Whoever believes this will be blessed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;The dough is rising, grandmother,&rdquo; said the youngest
sister, opening the door.</p>
<p>Every one gathered around the grandmother, for this was a ceremony
of great importance. The future happiness of the young couple might
depend upon it.</p>
<p>First the grandmother took the dough out of the bowl, kneaded it a
little, shaped it properly, and laid it in the baking-pan. The mother
was standing by with five candles in her hand; the grandmother took
them one by one, planted them in the centre and the four corners of the
<i>korowai</i>, and lighted them. Then all the women stood around and
began to sing. It was a somewhat sad tune, yet very sweet. The song had
many verses; the first was to the young couple, who would be
&ldquo;princess&rdquo; and &ldquo;prince&rdquo; for the next three
days; the next was to the Virgin; then followed verses to the sun, the
moon, the stars, and to a white stone beyond the seas. It was a long
song, and by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282"
name="pb282">282</a>]</span>time it was finished the candles were
burned down. Then the pan was carefully lifted into the oven.</p>
<p>After that all was hurry and bustle. The room had to be swept, and
long pieces of brightly striped cloth brought from the chest to cover
the bench that ran around the whole room. The cloths were of the same
colors as the brightly painted shelves above and they made the house
very beautiful. There were wreaths to be made for the
&ldquo;princess&rdquo; and the &ldquo;prince,&rdquo; and the
bride&rsquo;s wedding-dress must be laid out carefully in the
grandmother&rsquo;s room, where nothing could harm it. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Next morning was the wedding-day, and the bustle began
bright and early, for the table must be spread with all the good
things, and the <i>korowai</i> in the centre. Then every one put on his
best clothes. The &ldquo;prince,&rdquo; with as long a train of young
men as the village could afford, came to the door to claim his bride.
The &ldquo;princess&rdquo; came out of the grandmother&rsquo;s room in
her bridal-dress, a wreath of flowers on her head.</p>
<p>Some one put a wreath on the head of the &ldquo;prince,&rdquo; the
procession was formed, and they went to church. There the <i>pop</i>
preached a long sermon all about the duties of husband and wife, and
said Mass, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284" name=
"pb284">284</a>]</span>finally married the princess to her prince. In
reality it was the little boy&rsquo;s eldest sister who was married to
her betrothed, but for the three days of the wedding they were as much
prince and princess as if they had been born in an imperial palace.</p>
<p>Then followed the feast. I can never tell you of the eating and the
drinking, the songs that were sung and the jokes that went around the
table. Late in the afternoon the little boy went into the
grandmother&rsquo;s room. She had left the table an hour before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandmother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have eaten too much.
Please tell me a story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be very appropriate,&rdquo; said the grandmother,
&ldquo;if I tell you about</p>

<h3 class="main">&ldquo;YOUNG NEVERFULL.&rdquo;</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A certain housewife had a young servant-lad who
devoured everything eatable that came in his way. He would rummage in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name=
"pb285">285</a>]</span>the storeroom until he smelled out something
good, and would give himself no rest until he had devoured it all.</p>
<p>Now the woman had a jar of preserved fruit, and, as she feared that
the youngster would eat it and leave her nothing to put into her pies,
she said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My good boy, you have now eaten everything that I have except
this jam, and you have left this just as if you knew that it was
poisoned. See how good God is to have preserved you from it. One single
spoonful is enough to kill one instantly; so I warn you not to touch it
unless you want to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; answered the boy.</p>
<p>On the next Sunday, as the woman was getting ready to go to Mass,
she said to the boy, &ldquo;Cook the soup and boil the meat and roast
this duck; we will have a good dinner to-day. See that you have all
done and ready when I come home.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb286" href="#pb286" name="pb286">286</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well; it shall all be done,&rdquo; answered the boy.</p>
<p>When the woman was gone he cooked the soup and boiled the meat, and
then he put the duck upon the spit to roast. When he saw what a
delicious brown crisp was forming all over the duck, he thought,
&ldquo;It can roast itself another one,&rdquo; and ate the crisp all
off. He turned the spit and turned it, but the second brown crisp never
came.</p>
<p>When he saw this, he thought, &ldquo;When the mistress comes home
she will pepper me well,&rdquo; and he began to consider how he could
escape a beating. In his desperation he remembered the jar of poison
against which his mistress had warned him the day before. With a sudden
resolution he went into the storeroom and devoured the whole jarful of
preserved fruit and then crouched down in a corner to wait for
death.</p>
<p>Presently his mistress came home and cried out angrily, &ldquo;What
have you done to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287"
name="pb287">287</a>]</span>this duck?&rdquo; She was about to belabor
him well, when he cried, &ldquo;Ah, leave me in peace, dear mistress! I
shall die in a minute anyway, for I have eaten up all the
poison!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this the woman broke out into a laugh and could not refuse to
forgive him. The duck and the preserves, however, were gone all the
same.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;That was a greedy boy, grandmother,&rdquo; said the little
boy. &ldquo;Am I greedy because I ate too much at sister&rsquo;s
wedding-feast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was only grandmother&rsquo;s little joke. It is not
greedy to eat too much at a feast. Every one does,&rdquo; said the
grandmother.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>A wedding-feast lasts three days, as every one in Russia knows, and
during all that time there was eating and drinking going on in the
little boy&rsquo;s house, with much singing and many games, some of
them <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288" name=

when the fun had become pretty noisy, the little boy went to his

<h3 class="main">THE BASIL-PLANT</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time there was a woman to whom it was
revealed in a dream that she must fast one day in every week, for if
she neglected to do so she would give birth to something other than
human. The woman obeyed the behest, but one day she forgot to fast, and
not long after she gave birth to a wonderfully beautiful and fragrant
bush which in this world is called basil.</p>
<p>The woman watched and tended the bush, and the fame of it spread
through the whole world, even to a distant country, where the son of an
emperor heard of it and at once set out to see it.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e4435width" id="p0288"><img src=
"images/p0288.jpg" alt=
"When he beheld the basil-plant he felt an extraordinary love for it"
width="462" height="720">
<p class="figureHead">When he beheld the basil-plant he felt an
extraordinary love for it</p>
</div>
<p>When he beheld the basil-plant he felt an extraordinary love for it,
and he begged the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289"
name="pb289">289</a>]</span>mother either to present it to him or else
to sell it at a high price. But she would not hear a word of it, but
sent him away, saying, &ldquo;It is not to be bought, even for one-half
of your father&rsquo;s kingdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now the Prince&rsquo;s servant, who overheard this, whispered to his
master to say no more, and he would steal the plant for him. So said
and so done. The servant managed somehow to steal the plant, and
brought it to the Prince. The Prince, delighted to find his dearest
wish gratified, richly rewarded the servant and locked the bush safely
in a room.</p>
<p>Some days after the Prince invited a great company to a feast,
intending to take this opportunity to exhibit the basil-plant. The
feast was ready, and the servants hastened to announce it to the
company; but when they went back there lay all the meats and pastries
scattered in the dirt of the kitchen floor! <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name="pb290">290</a>]</span></p>
<p>When they saw this they hastened to tell the Prince, and as he saw
no way of getting over the difficulty, nothing was left for him but to
excuse himself to the guests for that day and invite them to return
upon the morrow.</p>
<p>The next day, when all was ready and the servants went to announce
it, some one came again and threw all the food about the kitchen and
broke all the dishes. The servants wondered at this no less than the
Emperor&rsquo;s son himself, and the Prince ordered that a feast should
again be prepared upon the third day and that some one should keep
watch through the keyhole to discover the mischief-maker.</p>
<p>When the meal was ready every one left the room and peeped through
the keyhole to catch the culprit. Behold, what did they see? A
golden-haired maiden!</p>
<p>The attendants flew back into the kitchen, held the little culprit
fast, and called to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href=
"#pb291" name="pb291">291</a>]</span>Emperor&rsquo;s son. As soon as he
beheld the maiden he was beside himself with surprise and joy, and he
asked her how she had come into the kitchen.</p>
<p>At first she was terrified, but at last she confessed to him
secretly that she was the basil-plant which he watched and tended so
carefully, and which shed such sweet perfume in his room; that she
thought the feast was in honor of his wedding, and this had made her
unhappy, for she had hoped that he would marry her and not another
maiden.</p>
<p>When the Prince heard these words and saw that the maiden was
beautiful beyond all comparison, he was most happy, and assured the
maiden that he would marry her as soon as she had embraced the
Christian faith. She declared herself ready to do this without
delay.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, the Prince&rsquo;s time of service in the
army arrived, and he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292"
name="pb292">292</a>]</span>was so much needed that he could by no
means be permitted to absent himself. He therefore called his beloved
to him before his departure and said to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go to the army. With a bleeding heart I part from you;
but, I pray you, change yourself again into a basil-plant and remain so
until my return. Show yourself to no one, whoever it may be, who enters
this room. And on my return, if God wills, I will ring this little
bell, and then do you again take on your present form.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he had once again kissed her she changed herself into a
basil-plant, and he rode away. But two maidens who loved the Prince,
and who of late had found themselves neglected and forgotten, soon
learned the cause of their sorrow&mdash;namely, that the Prince had
chosen another maiden. Therefore they agreed to force their way into
the Prince&rsquo;s room and search for some token of her. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293" name="pb293">293</a>]</span></p>
<p>When they were there they found nothing except his clothes and the
basil-plant, and in it they saw nothing remarkable. They rummaged all
around the room, trying to find some clew to the whereabouts of the
maiden, and one of them in her restlessness took the little bell in her
hand and rang it. The sorrowing golden-haired maiden, believing that it
was the Prince who rang the bell, immediately changed herself back into
human shape and suddenly appeared between the two.</p>
<p>At first they were all alike embarrassed, but the two trespassers
soon perceived that they had found what they sought, and they seized
the poor little creature, killed her, and carried her body into the
mountains. In the evening the servant who had charge of bringing the
maiden her supper found no basil-plant there, but in its place a
horrible pool of blood. In a moment he saw the great danger of his
position, and fearing the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href=
"#pb294" name="pb294">294</a>]</span>wrath of the Emperor&rsquo;s son
when he should return home, he fled away with all speed.</p>
<p>But to return to the maiden. An old woman who was going along among
the mountains found the headless body and the head lying near, and,
feeling compassion for the young creature, she gathered certain herbs
with which she called the maiden back to life. When the poor child
again awoke to life and found herself in the depths of the mountains,
she fell upon the old woman&rsquo;s neck and promised that she would
never abandon her.</p>
<p>But the old woman answered, &ldquo;My dear little daughter, go, in
God&rsquo;s name, wherever you like! I, a poor old worn-out woman, can
hardly support myself, to say nothing of you. But you are young and
strong, and, with God&rsquo;s help, will get on nicely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the maiden answered her, &ldquo;Neither now nor ever, so long as
God lives in heaven! You have called me back to life, and it is
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295" name=
"pb295">295</a>]</span>my debt and duty to love you till death. We
shall surely make our way in the world. I will sell my golden hair, and
will buy food for you; and when my hair is all sold I will gather herbs
in the mountains and feed you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last the old woman consented, and a few days later the maiden cut
off a lock of her golden hair and sent the old woman with it to market,
bidding her not to sell it for less than a hundred ducats. The old
woman went straight to the very city where the Prince lived, for he had
returned from camp and had ordered the whole city to go into mourning
because of his lost love.</p>
<p>Fortunately the old woman met the Prince and asked him if he would
like to buy a lock of golden hair. The moment the Prince saw the lock
he was beside himself with surprise, for he perceived at once that it
was his beloved&rsquo;s hair. So he seized hold of the old woman and
asked her how she <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href="#pb296"
name="pb296">296</a>]</span>came by it The old woman, terrified,
confessed the whole.</p>
<p>Upon this he quickly mounted his horse, placed the old woman upon
another, and they rode to the village where the old woman lived. When
they arrived they found the maiden bathed in tears, bewailing her lost
lover. He rushed to her, they kissed and embraced, and then went home,
taking the old woman with them.</p>
<p>When the Emperor&rsquo;s son had heard the details of the whole
story he commanded the two maidens to be put to death. Then he married
his own love. The old woman he honored as his own mother, and when she
died he gave her an imperial funeral.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;That is a beautiful story, grandmother,&rdquo; said the
little boy, &ldquo;although there is not a Dragon nor a Fox nor a Mouse
in it. There is a plant, though. I wish one of the plants in our field
would turn into a golden-haired <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb297"

one, big enough to play with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">The third evening of the wedding-feast had come, and
with music and singing the whole village escorted the young couple to
their house. They were to have a house of their own, and not live with
the bridegroom&rsquo;s father, for so had the <i>starosta</i> insisted.
Now they were there at last, and though some of the young men remained
in the streets singing noisily, the bride&rsquo;s family went quietly
home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems lonely without our princess,&rdquo; said the
<i>starosta</i> as they gathered around the stove. &ldquo;Grandmother,
I know the little boy is hoping for a story. Let us all hear it. Tell
one of your very best ones, that we <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time there was an Emperor who had three
sons and three daughters. As he was very old, his last hour drew nigh.
He therefore called his children to his bedside and laid earnest
command upon his sons to give their sisters, without hesitation, to the
first suitors who asked for them in marriage. &ldquo;Marry them
off,&rdquo; he said to the sons, &ldquo;or my curse will be upon
you!&rdquo; These were his last words.</p>
<p>After his death, day passed quietly after day for a while. Then one
evening there came a loud knocking at the door. The whole palace began
to rock amid a wild roaring, howling, crashing, flashing; the castle
was bathed in a sea of flame. Every heart <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb300" href="#pb300" name="pb300">300</a>]</span>was terrified, and
trembling took possession of every soul.</p>
<p>Suddenly a voice cried, &ldquo;Open the door, ye princes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up spoke the Emperor&rsquo;s eldest son, &ldquo;Do not open!&rdquo;
And the second said, &ldquo;On no account open!&rdquo; But the youngest
said, &ldquo;Then I will open the door myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sprang up and drew the bolts. Hardly was the door opened when a
fearful Being rushed in, the outline of whose form was hidden in
encircling flames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am come,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;to take your eldest
sister for my wife, and that at once. So give a short answer&mdash;yes
or no; I insist upon it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said the eldest brother, &ldquo;I will not give her to you. Why
should I, when I know neither who nor whence you are? You come here by
night, demand my sister&rsquo;s hand upon the instant, and I do not
even hear which way I am to turn when I wish to visit her.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href="#pb301" name=
"pb301">301</a>]</span></p>
<p>Said the second brother, &ldquo;Nor do I permit you to take away my
sister thus in the dead of night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the youngest interposed, &ldquo;Then I will give her away if you
two refuse. Have you already forgotten our father&rsquo;s
command?&rdquo; And taking his sister by the hand he gave her to the
stranger, saying, &ldquo;May she live happily with you and be ever
faithful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the sister crossed the threshold every one in the building fell
to the ground in fear and horror. It lightened, it thundered, it
crashed, it quaked, the whole fortress swayed heavily, as if heaven and
earth were falling together. Gradually the uproar died away, and the
rosy eastern light announced the coming morning.</p>
<p>As soon as day had broken the brothers searched for the traces which
they supposed would have been left by their tremendous nocturnal
visitor; but not a trace, not a footprint <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb302" href="#pb302" name="pb302">302</a>]</span>had he left behind.
All was swept away.</p>
<p>On the following night, at the self-same hour, the self-same
flashing, crashing din was heard around the imperial fortress, and a
voice without cried loudly, &ldquo;Open the door, you
princes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paralyzed with terror, they threw open the door and a fearful Form
rushed in, crying in a loud voice, &ldquo;Give me here the maiden, your
second sister! We have come to marry her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said the eldest brother, &ldquo;I will not give you my
sister!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said the second, &ldquo;I will not let my
sister&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the youngest broke in with, &ldquo;Then I will! Will you never
remember what our father commanded?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took his sister by the hand and led her to the wooer. &ldquo;Take
her; she will be happy with you and always good.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303" name="pb303">303</a>]</span></p>
<p>At this the powerful apparition vanished, and the maiden with
him.</p>
<p>As soon as morning dawned the brothers sought around the castle for
traces of the direction which the apparition had taken; but they found
nothing under the blessed sun, nor was there the slightest clew from
which they could make any sort of guess any more than if no one had
been there!</p>
<p>On the third night, at the same hour, the whole castle was again
shaken to the foundation by a horrible uproar and earthquake, and a
voice called out, &ldquo;Open the door, ye princes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Emperor&rsquo;s sons sprang nimbly to their feet and drew the
bolts, upon which a monstrous Form entered, exclaiming, &ldquo;We are
come to demand the hand of your youngest sister!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; shrieked the eldest and second brothers with
one voice. &ldquo;We will not let this one go away thus by night.
Surely we <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href="#pb304" name=
"pb304">304</a>]</span>must at least know of this our youngest sister
whom she marries and where she goes, that we may be able to visit
her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But up spoke the youngest brother, &ldquo;Then I will give her away
if you refuse. Have you quite forgotten what our father charged us on
his dying bed? It is not so long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took the sister by the hand and said, &ldquo;Here she is; take
her home and live happily and joyfully with her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a twinkling the terrible Being disappeared in the midst of a
fearful uproar.</p>
<p>When the morning dawned the brothers felt oppressed by anxiety,
being all uncertain as to the fate of their sisters. After a long
interval, during which no light had been thrown upon this matter, the
three brothers took counsel together:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens, did ever one know of anything so mysterious!
What has become of our sisters? For we have not the least <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href="#pb305" name="pb305">305</a>]</span>idea
of their abiding-place, nor any clew which can lead to their
discovery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At length one said to the others, &ldquo;Let us go forth to seek our
sisters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the three brothers made ready without losing a moment. They took
money enough for a long journey and went out into the wide world to
seek their sisters.</p>
<p>In the course of their wanderings they lost their way among the
mountains, where they wandered for a whole day. When night fell they
decided, on account of their horses, to encamp for the night near a
piece of water.</p>
<p>And so they did. They reached the shore of a lake, pitched their
tents, and sat down to supper. When they lay down to sleep the eldest
brother said, &ldquo;You may sleep, but I will stand guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the two younger brothers went peacefully to sleep, while the
eldest brother kept watch. At a certain hour of the night the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306" name=
"pb306">306</a>]</span>lake became agitated with a swaying motion which
startled the watcher not a little. He soon observed a shapeless form
arising out of the midst of the water and rushing straight toward him.
It was a frightful monster of a Dragon, with two great flapping ears,
which was rushing so fiercely upon him. The Prince bravely drew his
sword and, seizing the Dragon, cut off his head. Then he sliced off the
ears and put them into his wallet, and threw the head and the body back
into the lake.</p>
<p>Meantime the day had dawned, and the brothers still lay in profound
slumber, little dreaming of their eldest brother&rsquo;s heroic
exploit. He now awaked them, but said not a syllable about his
nocturnal adventure. They left that place and continued their journey,
and when twilight began to fall they once more agreed to seek a
halting-place near some piece of water. But they were much terrified to
find themselves quite <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href=
"#pb307" name="pb307">307</a>]</span>lost in a lonely wilderness. At
last, however, they came upon a tiny lake, where they decided to spend
the night. They kindled a fire, unpacked cooking utensils and food, and
took their evening meal. After that they disposed themselves to sleep.
Then said the second brother, &ldquo;Do you two go to rest; I will
mount guard to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two brothers therefore lay down to sleep, but the third
cheerfully sat up and kept watch. Suddenly a rustling sound from the
lake met his ears, and he saw a sight which curdled the blood in his
veins. A two-headed Dragon rushed tumultuously upon the brothers as if
to annihilate them all three.</p>
<p>Quick as thought the watcher sprang up, drew his glittering sword,
avoided the Dragon&rsquo;s attack, and cut off his two heads. Then he
sliced off the ears and put them into his wallet, throwing the other
parts of the monster back into the lake. His brothers knew <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href="#pb308" name=
"pb308">308</a>]</span>nothing of the affair, for both slept soundly
until dawn.</p>
<p>When day broke the second brother called to them, &ldquo;Wake up,
brothers, the morning dawns!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immediately they sprang up, packed their goods, and set forth upon
their way; but they had not the least idea where they were nor in what
country.</p>
<p>A great fear overwhelmed them that they might perish of hunger in
this wilderness, and they besought God to guide them, at least, to some
inhabited village or city, or to permit them to meet some human being,
for they had already wandered three days in this inhospitable
wilderness without coming to the end or finding any way out.</p>
<p>It was rather early in the day when they came to a pretty large lake
and decided to go no farther, but to make their camp on this lake-side.
For they said, &ldquo;If we go farther we shall very probably not find
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href="#pb309" name=
"pb309">309</a>]</span>any more water near which to make our
camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They remained, therefore, in this place, built a great fire, supped,
and made ready to sleep. Then said the youngest brother:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you two go to rest. I will take the watch
to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the two lay down and soon fell asleep, but the youngest brother
kept a sharp lookout, and often threw a glance over the shining surface
of the lake.</p>
<p>Thus passed away a portion of the night, when suddenly the lake
boiled up, surged, foaming, upon the fire and half-extinguished it. But
the watcher whipped out his sword and took his position close to the
fire. Suddenly a three-headed Dragon rushed forth and made as if to
kill the brothers.</p>
<p>Now was the hero-spirit of the youth tested. He waked not his
brothers, but went forth alone to meet the Dragon. Three <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href="#pb310" name=
"pb310">310</a>]</span>times he raised his sword, and each time he
smote off one of the monster&rsquo;s heads. Then he sliced off the
ears, and threw the shapeless remains into the water.</p>
<p>While this tremendous conflict was going on the fire died out,
having been flooded by the water. The Prince would not awake his
brothers, although he had no tinder-box of his own to rekindle it with,
but resolved to search around a little in the wilderness in hope of
stumbling upon some one who could help him.</p>
<p>But nowhere was there a mortal soul! At last he climbed into a high
tree and looked around in all directions to see what he might see.</p>
<p>As he was thus gazing far and wide his eyes were suddenly attracted
by a flash of light which seemed to be very near him. He descended the
tree and went in the direction of the light, hoping to get some fire
wherewith to rekindle the fire for his brothers. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href="#pb311" name="pb311">311</a>]</span></p>
<p>He went on for a long stretch, the light seeming always to be just
before him, when suddenly he found himself standing before a cave in a
rock in which nine Giants, gathered around an immense fire, were
roasting two men upon a spit, one on one side of the fire, the other on
the other. An enormous copper caldron, full to the brim with human
flesh, was bubbling over the fire.</p>
<p>The imperial Prince was horrified at this sight. He would have
turned back, but whither should he go? Where was there a way of escape
for him? He quickly recovered his self-possession, however, and cried
out, &ldquo;Good-morning, valiant comrades! I have long been seeking
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They received him most cordially, answering, &ldquo;God be with
thee, if thou art a true comrade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He replied, &ldquo;Indeed I am, and shall be all my life long. I
would risk my head for you.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb312"
href="#pb312" name="pb312">312</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; they answered. &ldquo;If you wish to be one
of us, are you ready to eat human flesh and take a share in our
adventures?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that I will,&rdquo; said the Prince. &ldquo;What you do,
that will I do also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faith, then all is well!&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;Sit down
among us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They settled themselves around the fire. The caldron was taken off,
its contents served, and the meal began. The Prince received his share,
but he knew how to manage, and, instead of eating, he slyly threw the
meat, bit by bit, behind him. He did the same with the roast. Then the
Giants said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, now, we must go a-hunting, for we must eat to-morrow as
well as to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the nine Giants set out, with the Prince for a tenth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; they said to him, &ldquo;not far from here is a
town in which reigns an Emperor. His city has fed us for several
years.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb313" href="#pb313" name=
"pb313">313</a>]</span></p>
<p>As they drew near to the city they pulled up two fir-trees by the
roots and carried them along. When they reached the town they set one
of the trees against the wall and called to the Prince, &ldquo;Come on,
climb up the wall here, and we will hand you the second tree. Seize it
by the point and let it down on the other side, but keep hold of the
top so that we may climb down by the trunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince accordingly scrambled up, but on receiving the second
tree he called out, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where to stand it; I am
not familiar with the place and dare not shove it over. Do one of you
come up and show me, and then I will make it all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the Giants climbed up to him, seized the fir-tree by the
point, and let it down on the other side of the wall. As he stood thus
bent over, the Prince drew his sword and struck off his head, and the
dead Giant tumbled off the wall into the city. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href="#pb314" name="pb314">314</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then the Prince cried to the others, &ldquo;All right! Come on now,
one at a time, that I may help you along in the same way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One after another unsuspiciously climbed up, only to meet death at
the hands of the Prince. When he had made an end of all the nine he let
himself down by the fir-tree into the city, which he explored in every
direction. No sound of human voice reached his ear. All was a drear,
horrible desolation. &ldquo;Has the whole population been robbed and
murdered by the Giants?&rdquo; he thought to himself.</p>
<p>For a long time he wandered about the desolate city, until he came
to a very high tower, from one window of which shone out the light of a
taper. He threw open the door, rushed up the tower stair, and hastened
straight to that room.</p>
<p>On the threshold he stood still in amazement. The room was richly
hung and decorated with gold, silk, and velvet, and not a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315" name="pb315">315</a>]</span>soul
within except a maiden who lay upon a couch, outstretched in deep
slumber. The Prince was rooted to the spot at the sight of the maiden,
for she was wonderfully beautiful. But at that moment he became aware
of a great serpent which, gliding along the wall, stretched out its
head directly over the head of the maiden, coiling itself up in
readiness to spring and strike her upon the brow, between the eyes.</p>
<p>Then the Prince sprang quickly with his pocket-knife, which in a
trice he had drawn from his pocket, and pinned the serpent&rsquo;s head
to the wall. Then saying these words, &ldquo;God grant that no hand but
mine may draw this knife out from the wall,&rdquo; he went quickly
away. He climbed up by one fir-tree and down by the other, and so got
over the wall. Arrived at the Giants&rsquo; cave, he took some fire and
ran back to his brothers, who were still buried in profound slumber. As
he kindled the fire day began to dawn in <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb316" href="#pb316" name="pb316">316</a>]</span>the east. He awakened
his brothers, and they set forth upon their journey.</p>
<p>That same day they came to the highway leading to the
before-mentioned city. A mighty Emperor reigned there who used to go
about the city every morning shedding bitter tears because his people
were exterminated and eaten by the giants, and because of his constant
fear that his only daughter would fall a sacrifice to their gluttony.
On this morning he was going about the city as usual. It lay empty and
deserted; the inhabitants had dwindled away to a mere remnant; most of
them had found a grave in the giants&rsquo; maws.</p>
<p>As I have said, the Emperor was thus reviewing his city when
suddenly his eyes fell upon the uprooted fir-tree which still leaned
against the wall, and as he drew nearer he beheld a wonderful sight:
there lay the nine Giants, the very pests of the city, with their heads
all cut off! <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb317" href="#pb317" name=
"pb317">317</a>]</span></p>
<p>This sight gave the King unspeakable joy. The people also gathered
together to pray God that blessing and happiness might descend upon the
giant-slayer. At that very moment a servant came from the imperial
citadel to say that a serpent had nearly been the death of the
Emperor&rsquo;s daughter. Upon this the Emperor betook himself
straightway to the citadel, and to the very chamber of his daughter.
Arrived there, he saw upon the wall the impaled serpent, and tried with
his own hand to draw out the knife, but in vain.</p>
<p>Then the Emperor sent a proclamation through his whole empire:
&ldquo;Whoever has slain the giants and impaled the serpent, let him
make himself known, that the Emperor may richly reward him and bestow
upon him the hand of his daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This proclamation was issued in every province of the empire. The
Emperor also gave command that great inns should be <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb318" href="#pb318" name=
"pb318">318</a>]</span>erected upon the principal highways, where all
travellers should be stopped and asked whether they knew who had
overcome the giants; and whoever should discover the man, let him
hasten with utmost speed to the Emperor to receive a rich reward.</p>
<p>According to the imperial proclamation, great inns were erected upon
the principal highways, and every traveller stopped, examined, and the
whole affair explained to him.</p>
<p>After a while the three Princes who were seeking their sisters came
to pass the night at one of these inns. After supper the landlord
joined the company and began to boast of his wonderful exploits. At
last he turned to the three brothers with the question, &ldquo;And what
doughty deeds have you done up to this time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the eldest brother began, &ldquo;As I and my brothers were upon
our travels it came to pass one night that we made our halt on
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href="#pb319" name=
"pb319">319</a>]</span>the border of a lake in a great wilderness.
While my brothers were asleep and I keeping watch, a Dragon came up out
of the lake to destroy me. I drew my sword out of the scabbard and
struck off his head. If you don&rsquo;t believe me, here are his
ears.&rdquo; And he drew the ears out of his wallet and threw them upon
the table.</p>
<p>When the second brother heard this, he began, &ldquo;I had the watch
on the second night, and I killed a two-headed Dragon. If you
don&rsquo;t believe me, here are the ears which I cut from his two
heads for a witness.&rdquo; He said it and showed the two pairs of
ears.</p>
<p>The youngest brother heard the whole in silence. The landlord now
turned to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Heaven, youngster, your brothers are valiant heroes! Come,
let us hear if you can also boast of any doughty deeds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hesitatingly the youngest began his story: &ldquo;Well, I also did a
trifle. It was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb320" href="#pb320" name=
"pb320">320</a>]</span>on the very third night, beside the lake in the
wilderness. You, my brothers, were asleep. I kept watch. At a certain
hour of the night the lake surged up and a three-headed Dragon arose
from it, who would have annihilated us. Then I drew a sword and cut off
all three of his heads. If you don&rsquo;t believe it, here are the
three pairs of ears!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon this the two brothers were dumb with astonishment. But the
youngest went on with his story: &ldquo;In the meantime the fire had
gone out, and I went forth to seek a light. While straying around among
the hills I stumbled upon nine giants in a cave;&rdquo; and so he went
on and told all his adventures in order, and every one was struck with
amazement at the wonderful tale.</p>
<p>No sooner had the landlord heard the story than he ran secretly to
the Emperor and told him the whole affair. The Emperor gave him a great
sum of money, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href="#pb321"
name="pb321">321</a>]</span>sent his people at once to bring the three
princes before him.</p>
<p>When they came into the emperor&rsquo;s presence he put the
following question to the youngest: &ldquo;Is it you who performed the
wonders in our city, killing the giants and saving my only daughter
from destruction?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was I, mighty Emperor,&rdquo; replied the Prince.
Hereupon the Emperor married his daughter to the young Prince and
raised him to the highest office in the kingdom.</p>
<p>Then the Emperor said to the two elder brothers, &ldquo;If it please
you to remain in my empire, I will give you each a wife and will permit
you to build strongholds for yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But they told him they were already married, and explained that they
had undertaken this journey merely to seek out their sisters. When the
Emperor heard this he detained only the youngest brother, his
son-in-law, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb322" href="#pb322" name=
"pb322">322</a>]</span>and to the two other brothers he gave two mules
laden with gold. So the two brothers returned home to their own
kingdom.</p>
<p>Still the youngest brother thought continually of his sisters, and
kept always in mind the hope of yet seeking them out. But on the other
hand he was pained at the thought of parting from his young wife, and
besides he knew that the Emperor would never consent to his leaving
him. So he was continually racked with anxiety about his sisters.</p>
<p>One day the Emperor went hunting, and before setting out he said to
his son-in-law, &ldquo;Do you remain in the castle during my absence. I
give to you nine keys which you must keep carefully by you. I give you
free leave to open three or four rooms. You will find in them silver
and gold in abundance; there is also no lack of weapons, or of any kind
of treasure. You may even, if you feel inclined, open eight of the
rooms. But beware <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href="#pb323"
name="pb323">323</a>]</span>of unlocking the ninth. Leave that one
alone; for,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;if you do not it will be the worse
for you.&rdquo; Upon this the Emperor departed, leaving his son-in-law
at home alone.</p>
<p>Hardly was the Emperor gone when the Prince began to open one door
after another, until he had examined eight rooms in succession. His
eyes beheld in them treasures of all kinds. When at last he came to the
door of the ninth room he said to himself, &ldquo;I have seen and done
so many wonderful things, and shall it be forbidden me to enter a
certain room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he unlocked the door and went in. What a sight! There was a man
whose legs up to his knees and whose arms up to the elbows were
<span class="corr" id="xd21e4753" title=
"Source: incased">encased</span> in iron; from his neck hung heavy iron
chains, the ends of which were fastened to stakes driven into the floor
on all sides, holding him so securely that he could not stir. Before
him a stream <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href="#pb324" name=
"pb324">324</a>]</span>of water gushed from a golden vessel and flowed
into a golden basin which stood near; beside it was a golden jug,
beautifully adorned with jewels. The man longed to drink the water, but
he could not reach the jug.</p>
<p>When the imperial Prince saw this he started backward; but the
fettered man cried, &ldquo;Oh, come to me, I beseech you, in the name
of the living God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince drew nearer, and the man continued, &ldquo;Oh, do a pious
act; let me drain a jug of water! Be assured I will reward you for it
with an additional life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince considered the proposition. &ldquo;Can there be anything
better for me than to secure for myself an additional life?&rdquo; He
took the jug, filled it, and raised it to the man&rsquo;s lips, who
emptied it at a single draught. Upon this the Prince asked him,
&ldquo;In the name of Heaven, who are you?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href="#pb325" name="pb325">325</a>]</span></p>
<p>The man answered, &ldquo;My name is Steelpacha.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince now turned toward the door, but the man implored him,
&ldquo;Give me another jug of water, and I will give you a second
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince thought, &ldquo;He will give me a second life; I have one
into the bargain. This will be a prodigy indeed!&rdquo; and he filled
the jug again and put it to the man&rsquo;s lips.</p>
<p>He then turned away, and already held the door-latch in his hand
when Steelpacha called to him, &ldquo;O sir, come back to me! You have
twice acted nobly by me; prove yourself a man a third time and I will
give you a third life. Take this jug, fill it to the brim, and pour it
over my head; and for this labor of love I will give you a third
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Prince heard this he turned back, took the jug, filled it
with water, and poured it over the man&rsquo;s head. The moment
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href="#pb326" name=
"pb326">326</a>]</span>the water touched him the chains about his neck
fell asunder and all the bonds which held him were unloosed. Quick as
lightning Steelpacha sprang up, spread a pair of wings, flew out of the
window, snatched up the Princess, the wife of his deliverer, took
flight with her under his wing, and in a moment had disappeared from
view. That was a prodigy indeed!</p>
<p>The Prince now looked forward with deepest dread to the
Emperor&rsquo;s return. However, when the Emperor came home, the Prince
told the whole story exactly as it had happened. The Emperor was beside
himself with grief. &ldquo;Why did you do thus?&rdquo; said he
reproachfully. &ldquo;Did I not expressly forbid you to enter the ninth
room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince answered soothingly, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry with me.
I will go at once to seek Steelpacha and rescue my wife from
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Emperor tried to dissuade him from <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb327" href="#pb327" name="pb327">327</a>]</span>this plan.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;you shall on no
account move a step from this place. You have no idea who Steelpacha
is. Many an army and much treasure did I waste before I got him in my
power. So remain quietly with me. I will provide another wife for you.
And don&rsquo;t be unhappy; I love you as my own son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Prince was deaf to all these persuasions, and adhered to his
first resolution. He provided himself with the necessary money, mounted
his horse, and went forth into the world to seek Steelpacha. For a long
time he wandered about, and at last he arrived at a city. He was gazing
around with some curiosity, when suddenly a woman called to him from a
balcony, &ldquo;You Prince, get down from your horse and come into the
court!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the Prince entered the court the woman came to meet him. He
looked narrowly at her and recognized his eldest sister. They
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb328" href="#pb328" name=
"pb328">328</a>]</span>flew into each other&rsquo;s arms and lavished
sweet kisses upon each other.</p>
<p>The sister was the first to speak. &ldquo;Come out upon the balcony
with me, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they were upon the balcony the Prince asked his sister whom she
had married, and she answered, &ldquo;I am married to the Emperor of
the Dragons. My husband is himself a Dragon. So, brother, it would be
worth your while to hide, for my husband often says he would cut his
brothers-in-law in small bits if he ever laid eyes upon them. Let me
first question him; if he promises to do you no harm I will tell him of
your arrival.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So said and so done. The sister concealed her brother and his horse.
The evening drew on. The Dragon&rsquo;s supper was ready; they were
awaiting his arrival, when at last he came. When he flew in the whole
earth was bathed in blinding light; but he had hardly entered when he
called to his wife: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb329" href="#pb329"
name="pb329">329</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Wife, I smell men&rsquo;s bones. Who is here? Tell me
quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one is here,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not possible,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>Upon this the wife said, &ldquo;I want to ask you a question, and do
you answer me truly and honestly. Would you do any harm to my brothers
if they happened to come here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Dragon-emperor answered, &ldquo;I would have the eldest and the
second killed and roasted, but I would do nothing to the
youngest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon this she said, &ldquo;My youngest brother, your brother-in-law,
is arrived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Dragon-emperor heard this he cried, &ldquo;Out with him,
then!&rdquo; And when the sister brought her brother from his
hiding-place the Emperor ran to meet him and showered kisses upon
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome here, brother-in-law!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God be with you, sister&rsquo;s husband!&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb330" href="#pb330" name="pb330">330</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Where were you hiding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here I am!&rdquo; And he told him the object of his journey,
from beginning to end.</p>
<p>The Dragon-emperor said to him, &ldquo;You are running the greatest
risk, God help you! The day before yesterday Steelpacha flew past with
your wife. I was awaiting him with seven thousand dragons, but we could
not overcome him. I adjure you, let that fiend alone. I will give you
money to your heart&rsquo;s desire; just go quietly home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Prince would not hear a word of this advice, and
emphatically declared that he would continue his journey on the morrow.
When the Emperor saw that he could not prevent him, nor induce him to
turn back, he drew a feather out of his wing and gave it to his
brother-in-law, with these words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give good heed to what I now tell you. Take this feather of
mine, and if you come across Steelpacha and find yourself in great
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href="#pb331" name=
"pb331">331</a>]</span>danger, then burn my feather; that very moment I
will come to your aid with the whole strength of my army.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince concealed the feather in a safe place and went his way.
He travelled on and on until he reached a second great city. Here
again, as he was going through the city, a woman called to him from a
balcony:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho, there, you Prince, dismount from your horse and come into
the court!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince rode into the court. Behold, who comes to meet him? It is
his second sister! They rush into each other&rsquo;s arms and kiss each
other heartily. Then the sister led her brother into the castle.</p>
<p>When she had put the horse into the stable she asked the object of
his journey, and he told her the whole story of his adventures, finally
asking her, &ldquo;And whom have you married, dear sister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She answered, &ldquo;I am married to the Emperor of the Falcons. He
will come home <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb332" href="#pb332" name=
"pb332">332</a>]</span>to-night. But I must carefully conceal you, for
he is furious against my brothers.&rdquo; So saying, she concealed the
Prince.</p>
<p>In a little while the Falcon-emperor came home, and the whole city
quaked with the tumult of his approach. Supper was served at once, but
not before he had cried to his wife, &ldquo;I smell men&rsquo;s
flesh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wife answered, &ldquo;What are you thinking of,
husband?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last, after talking for some time of this thing and that, she
asked him, &ldquo;Would you do any harm to my brothers if they were to
come here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Emperor said, &ldquo;It would surely go hard with the eldest and
the second, but I would do nothing to the youngest.&rdquo; Then she
told him of her youngest brother&rsquo;s arrival.</p>
<p>The Falcon-emperor commanded his wife to bring her brother before
him, and as soon as he beheld him he fell upon his neck and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb333" href="#pb333" name=
"pb333">333</a>]</span>kissed him. &ldquo;Welcome, dear
brother-in-law!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lucky and joyful meeting, dear sister&rsquo;s
husband!&rdquo; answered the Prince; upon which they sat down to
supper.</p>
<p>After supper the Emperor asked his brother-in-law concerning the
object of his journey, and the Prince replied that he was seeking
Steelpacha, and told him all his adventures. But the Emperor began to
counsel him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give up your journey,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Just let me tell
you something about Steelpacha. That very day on which he stole your
wife I was awaiting him with five thousand falcons, and waged a fearful
battle with him. Blood flowed knee-deep around us, yet we could not
prevail against him. And how shall you, a single man, overmaster him?
So I give you this well-meant advice: Go back home. So much of my
treasure as your heart desires is yours; take it and go.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb334" href="#pb334" name=
"pb334">334</a>]</span></p>
<p>But the Prince answered, &ldquo;Hearty thanks for your offer, but go
back with my task unperformed I will not. No, never! I must yet find
Steelpacha.&rdquo; For he thought to himself, &ldquo;Why should I not?
Have I not three lives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Falcon-emperor became convinced that he could not move him
from his purpose he drew a feather out of his wing and gave it to him,
with these words, &ldquo;Here, take this feather of mine, and if you
come into great danger strike a fire and burn it. I will come at once
to your aid with all my forces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the Prince took the feather and set forth to seek Steelpacha.</p>
<p>For a long time he went up and down through the wide world, until at
last he reached a third city. He had hardly entered it when a woman
called to him from a balcony, &ldquo;Dismount and come into the
court!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince turned his horse and rode into <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb335" href="#pb335" name="pb335">335</a>]</span>the
court. Behold, here is his youngest sister! They fall into each
other&rsquo;s arms and lavish kisses upon each other. She led the horse
into the stable, the brother into the castle. Then the Prince asked,
&ldquo;Sister, whom have you married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she answered, &ldquo;My consort is the Emperor of the Eagles; it
is he whom I have married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Eagle-emperor came home that night his wife met him
affectionately; but he paid no attention to her greeting, but asked
her, &ldquo;What man has come into my castle? Tell me at
once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She answered, &ldquo;There is no one here,&rdquo; and they sat down
to supper. During supper she asked him, as if by chance, &ldquo;Would
you do any harm to my brothers if they should suddenly
arrive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Emperor answered, &ldquo;The eldest and the second I should kill
without hesitation, but not the youngest. On the contrary, I
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb336" href="#pb336" name=
"pb336">336</a>]</span>would hasten to his aid at any time, as far as
it was in my power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she said to the Emperor, &ldquo;My youngest brother is come to
pay us a visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Emperor commanded that he should be presented at once, went to
meet him, and greeted him with, &ldquo;Welcome, dear
brother-in-law!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other answered, &ldquo;A lucky and joyful meeting, dear
sister&rsquo;s husband!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they sat down to the table.</p>
<p>After supper they talked of one thing and another, and at last the
Prince told them that he was seeking for Steelpacha. When the
Eagle-emperor heard this he said everything he could think of to
dissuade him from this idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear brother-in-law,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;leave that fiend
alone and give up your journey. Stay, rather, here with me; you shall
be made happy in every respect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Prince paid no heed to his words, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb337" href="#pb337" name="pb337">337</a>]</span>and
as soon as morning dawned he made ready and set off to seek Steelpacha.
But before he went away the Eagle-emperor, who saw that he could not
turn him from his purpose, drew forth a feather from his wing and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take this feather, brother-in-law, and if ever you are in
need or danger, strike a fire and burn it. I will come at once with my
eagles to help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince put the feather in his pocket and set forth.</p>
<p>Thus he roved around the world from city to city, going ever farther
and farther, till at last one day he discovered his wife in a cavern.
She was not a little surprised to see him, and cried out to him,
&ldquo;In the name of Heaven, husband, how came you here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hastily told her his adventures, and added, &ldquo;Wife, my wife!
Quick, let us flee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she hesitated. &ldquo;Where shall we go, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb338" href="#pb338" name=
"pb338">338</a>]</span>since Steelpacha can overtake us in a moment? He
will kill you on the spot, and bring me back here again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Prince, being mindful of the three lives which Steelpacha
had given him, still coaxed his wife to flee, and they set out. Hardly
had they started when Steelpacha heard of it, gave rapid chase, and
overtook them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oho, little Prince!&rdquo; he cried out, &ldquo;you would
steal my wife, would you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tore her away from the Prince, and continued, &ldquo;This time I
give you your life, for I have not forgotten that I promised you three
lives; but go now, and never come back again after her, for if you do
your life is at stake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words Steelpacha took the woman away, while the Prince
remained alone, in doubt what to do next. At last he resolved to go
after his wife again.</p>
<p>When he arrived near the cavern he <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb339" href="#pb339" name="pb339">339</a>]</span>waited for his
opportunity till Steelpacha should be gone away; and once more he fled,
taking his wife with him.</p>
<p>Steelpacha soon heard of it, pursued after them, overtook them,
fitted an arrow to his bow, and cried out, &ldquo;Would you rather that
I kill you with this arrow, or shall I cut you down with my
sword?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince began to beg with all his might, and Steelpacha said to
him, &ldquo;This second time I give you your life, but let me tell you
one thing: don&rsquo;t you try again to carry away this woman, for I
will not again give you your life, but will kill you on the spot as
dead as a mouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words he seized the woman and carried her away, while the
Prince again remained alone, always planning how to rescue his wife.
Finally he said to himself, &ldquo;After all, why should I be afraid? I
still have two lives&mdash;that one which he gave me and the one I had
before.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb340" href="#pb340" name=
"pb340">340</a>]</span></p>
<p>So he resolved to go back to his wife the next day when Steelpacha
was absent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said to her, &ldquo;let us flee!&rdquo; She
objected that it was useless to flee, since they would be at once
overtaken; but he constrained her to go with him.</p>
<p>But very soon Steelpacha overtook them, and cried out to the Prince,
&ldquo;Wait, just wait! I will never forgive you this!&rdquo; The
Prince was terrified and began to beg for mercy, but Steelpacha
silenced him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember that I gave you three lives? All right; now I
give you the third, and you have nothing more to expect from me. So go
home in peace, and beware of hazarding the life which God lent
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Prince saw that he was powerless against the might of
Steelpacha he turned back homeward with a heavy heart. Suddenly he
remembered what his brothers-in-law had said to him when they gave him
the feathers, and he said to himself, &ldquo;Come <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb341" href="#pb341" name="pb341">341</a>]</span>what
come may, I will go once more to rescue my wife, and in case of need I
will burn the feathers and call my brothers-in-law to my
assistance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So said and so done.</p>
<p>He went back to the cavern and saw his wife in Steelpacha&rsquo;s
arms. He waited around till the latter had gone away, and then showed
himself to his wife. She was not a little frightened, and cried out in
terror, &ldquo;In the name of Heaven! Is life so hateful that you come
back again for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He calmed her and told her that his brothers-in-law had promised to
help him in utmost need. &ldquo;And therefore,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I
am come for you once more; make ready to flee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did so, and they hastened away; but Steelpacha soon got news of
their flight, and cried to them from afar, &ldquo;Just wait, little
Prince; you haven&rsquo;t escaped me yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as soon as the Prince saw Steelpacha <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb342" href="#pb342" name="pb342">342</a>]</span>he
drew the three feathers and his tinder-box out of his pocket, struck a
light, and kindled the feathers one by one. But while they were
kindling Steelpacha overtook him, drew his sword, and cleft the Prince
in half.</p>
<p>That very moment what a prodigy occurred! There came flying the
Dragon-emperor with his dragons, the Falcon-emperor with his falcons,
and the Eagle-emperor with all his eagles, and waged battle with
Steelpacha. Blood flowed in streams, but fortune favored Steelpacha,
and he made off safely, carrying his prize, the Princess, with him.</p>
<p>The three emperors now took counsel over their
brother-in-law&rsquo;s body, and decided to recall him to life. So they
summoned three of the swiftest dragons and asked which one of them
could most speedily bring some water from the river Jordan. The first
one said, &ldquo;I can do it within half an hour&rdquo;; the second
said, &ldquo;I can do it in a quarter of an <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb343" href="#pb343" name=
"pb343">343</a>]</span>hour&rdquo;; the third said, &ldquo;I will have
it here in nine minutes.&rdquo; The emperors said to this one,
&ldquo;Then set out, Dragon, as fast as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Dragon put forth all his impetuous strength, and truly within
nine minutes he brought back the water from the Jordan. The emperors
took the water, poured it over the two portions of the Prince&rsquo;s
body, and scarcely had the water touched them when the young man sprang
upon his feet, safe and sound, as if nothing had happened to him.</p>
<p>The emperors then counselled him, &ldquo;Now go back home, since you
have been restored to life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Prince answered that he must once more try his luck, and, by
one means or another, free his wife from the clutches of that fiend.
His imperial brothers-in-law remonstrated:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do give it up! You will surely perish <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb344" href="#pb344" name="pb344">344</a>]</span>this
time, for you have no life at command except the one God lent
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But for all answer the Prince remained dumb.</p>
<p>Then the emperors said, &ldquo;All right; if you are bent upon
trying again, come what come may, at least don&rsquo;t attempt to get
your wife away by flight, but beg her to wheedle Steelpacha into
telling her wherein his strength lies. Then bring us word, that we may
help you to get the best of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the Prince stole secretly to his wife and told her how she should
coax Steelpacha to tell her the secret of his strength. Then he betook
himself to some place of safety.</p>
<p>When Steelpacha came home the Princess beset him with questions.
&ldquo;In Heaven&rsquo;s name, do tell me wherein your strength
lies!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steelpacha answered, &ldquo;My pretty wife, my strength lies in my
sword.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb345" href="#pb345" name=
"pb345">345</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then the Princess prayed to the sword as if to God. At sight of this
Steelpacha burst into a mocking laugh and said to her, &ldquo;Oh, you
simple woman! my strength lies not in my sword but in my
arrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Therefore she fell upon her knees before the arrow and began to pray
to it. Then Steelpacha said, &ldquo;My wife, some one must have well
taught you how to coax from me the secret of my strength. If your
husband were alive I should say it was he who had taught
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she swore by body and soul that no one had taught her, no one
had been there.</p>
<p>After several days her husband came again, and she told him that
thus far it had been impossible to learn from Steelpacha wherein his
strength lay. But the Prince answered, &ldquo;Try again,&rdquo; and
went away.</p>
<p>When Steelpacha came home she asked him anew wherein his strength
lay. Upon which he answered her, &ldquo;Since I see that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb346" href="#pb346" name="pb346">346</a>]</span>you
have a high respect for my strength, I will confess the truth about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he told her: &ldquo;Far from here is a mountain-peak. On this
mountain-peak lives a Fox. The Fox has a heart in which a bird is
concealed; this bird holds my strength. But that Fox is very hard to
catch, for he has many transformations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day, when Steelpacha was away from home, the Prince came
again to his wife to learn what he had told her. She repeated
everything carefully, and the Prince went straight away to his
brothers-in-law with the much-longed-for news. They received it with
joy, and at once set out with the Prince to go to that
mountain-peak.</p>
<p>Arrived there, they set the eagles upon the Fox, which immediately
took refuge in a lake and there changed himself into a gull with six
wings. But the falcons gave battle to the gull and drove him thence. He
flew <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb347" href="#pb347" name=
"pb347">347</a>]</span>high amid the clouds, the falcons ever
following. In a trice the gull changed himself into a fox again and
tried to escape into the earth; but, falling into the power of the
eagles and all the rest of the mighty host, he was surrounded and taken
prisoner.</p>
<p>Then the emperors commanded that the Fox should be cut open and his
heart taken out. A fire was kindled, the heart cut open, the bird taken
out and cast into the flames. As soon as the bird was burned Steelpacha
vanished forever.</p>
<p>So the Prince took his wife and went happily home.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;That is one of your very best stories,&rdquo; said the
<i>starosta</i>. &ldquo;How it does bring back old times! While I was
listening I could hardly believe that this big man here by the stove is
I. It seemed rather as if I must be the little boy yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did grandmother tell these same stories <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb348" href="#pb348" name="pb348">348</a>]</span>to
you when you were little, father?&rdquo; asked the little boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many and many a time. And I&rsquo;ll warrant she has as many
more to tell you as those you have heard already. But it is late, and
we have not had much sleep these last few nights. So every one to bed,
and don&rsquo;t forget to thank God for a happy wedding and a good son
and brother-in-law.&rdquo;</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
